The canopy, she says, is\n“like the atmosphere of an open field.” Home to thousands of unique plant species, rain\nforests are important to the health of our planet. But the canopy layer is in trouble.<br/>THE\nMYSTERIOUS CANOPY<br/>As a forest ecologist, Nadkarni uses mountain-climbing techniques, construction\ncranes, and hot-air balloons to research life in the mysterious canopy. High up in the canopy layer,\nshe studies a special group of plants called <i>epiphytes</i>. Worldwide, there are over 28,000\nspecies of epiphytes, and mosses are the most common type. Epiphytes are sometimes called “air\nplants” because most do not have roots in the ground. Also, many of them live more than 100\nfeet (over 30 meters) above the forest floor. So how do these unusual plants survive? <br/>Epiphyte\nroots attach to the branches of other plants, particularly trees. However, epiphytes don’t take\nnutrients from their host tree. Instead, they absorb water and nutrients from the atmosphere.\nNadkarni says that epiphytes have “a tremendous capacity for holding on to nutrients and\nwater.” Some host trees take some of these nutrients, too, through tiny roots that grow out of\ntheir branches. Because they grow so high in the canopy, epiphytes are also able to get energy from\nthe sun.<br/>CLINGING TO LIFE<br/>These canopy communities of epiphytes are fragile<sup>1</sup>;\nepiphytes need a specific balance of light, nutrients, and water to survive. In recent years, humans\nhave destroyed many rain forests to make room for agriculture and other activities. This has changed\nthe balance of light, nutrients<sup>2</sup>, and water in the environment. Nadkarni says that\nepiphytes are an essential part of the rain forest, and not just “insignificant bits of\ngreen.” Epiphytes play a vital part in keeping the climate stable. They keep the rain forests\ncooler and wetter by storing and then releasing huge amounts of water.<br/>In the temperate rain\nforests of the Pacific Northwest, epiphytes are facing problems of a different kind. There, mosses\nare stripped<sup>3</sup> from the trees and sold to florists and garden centers. It’s a big\nindustry that supplies jobs and income for the region. Unfortunately, these mosses take a long\ntime—over 20 years—to regenerate. Once they are damaged, mosses cannot easily grow back.\nFarming epiphytes is not sustainable, so Nadkarni wondered, “What can I, as an ecologist, do\nabout that?”<br/>RECONNECTING PEOPLE<br/>Nadkarni realized that it wasn’t enough to tell\nother scientists about the problems in the rain forests. She needed to reach out to the general\npublic. Over the past few years, she has developed innovative projects to “reconnect people\nwith trees.” She has worked with rappers, writers, and artists to capture the attention of\nyoung people in particular. Through these projects, Nadkarni is spreading the word about the\nimportance of epiphytes and the world’s forest canopies. <br/><br/><sup>1</sup><b>fragile</b>:\n<i>adj.</i> easily damaged or broken<br/><sup>2</sup><b>nutrients</b>: <i>n.</i> ingredients that\nplants and animals need in order to live<br/><sup>3</sup><b>strip</b>: <i>v.</i> to take off or\nremove</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
