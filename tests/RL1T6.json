But the project was abandoned when the\nconstruction company closed, and the building was never finished. However, local residents saw an\nopportunity. They began to turn the empty offices into apartments and stores. They painted the\nentrance and planted trees. As there were no working elevators, residents used taxis to reach the\nupper floors via the parking garage. Within a few years, 3,000 people were sharing a community that\nthey built themselves. The abandoned tower, says photographer and TED speaker Iwan Baan, turned into\n“a living city.”<br/><br/>RECYCLED HOMES<br/><br/>In Huntsville, Texas, a community is\nbuilding houses from recycled building materials. How did this start? Local builder and TED speaker\nDan Phillips noticed that construction companies traditionally threw away large amounts of unused\nbricks, wood, and cement when they built homes. Phillips decided to work with local people and\nhomeowners to build houses using these materials. These people are not professional builders, so\nPhillips teaches them the skills and techniques they need. The houses look different from normal\nhouses. Phillips encourages the homeowners to be creative and make each house look\nunique.<br/><br/><b></b></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

More than 800 million people live in urban\nslums<sup>1</sup>. One possible solution for this problem is through\n“cargotecture”—using shipping containers to build houses and other structures.\nThere are an estimated 17 million shipping containers moving cargo on ships, trucks, and trains.\nAround two million, however, sit unused. More goods are imported in shipping containers to some\ncountries than are exported to other parts of the world, and in some cases, it is actually cheaper to\nbuild new containers than to ship them back empty.  Shipping containers have long been used to\nprovide emergency shelter after disasters, but in recent years, they have also been used to build\neverything from simple houses to shopping malls to high-rise student dormitories.<br/><br/><b>Paragraph\n2<br/><br/></b>Shipping containers made of steel or aluminum are made to fit together, so they can be\nused as building blocks<sup>2</sup> to create all sorts of structures. They are more resistant to\nhurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes than ordinary building materials.  Recycling used\ncontainers as living spaces is environmentally friendly and inexpensive—they typically cost\nbetween US $1,000 and US $2,000 per container. They are fire proof and termite<sup>3 </sup>proof. The\ncontainers can be converted in a central location, transported, and then assembled on-site, saving\ntime and money. Containers are so versatile<sup>3</sup> that it is up to the architect whether to\nhide them or expose them, to use them as one part of a building or to design an entire building,\nusing them.<br/><br/><b>Paragraph 3<br/><br/></b>However, that doesn't mean they're perfect:\nThe floors of the containers have often been treated with pesticides and other chemicals that were\nused to make them safe for transportation, so they have to be thoroughly cleaned and the floors\ncovered.  Converting them into usable structures can use a lot of energy. And individual\ncontainers are boxy and small. The containers typically come in two lengths, about 14 meters long and\naround 7 meters long, and are less than 3 meters wide and 3 meters high when insulation and interior\nwalls are added. But architects and designers worldwide have managed to do a lot with them.\n<br/><br/><b>Paragraph 4<br/><br/></b>In the city of Bangalore, architect Kameshwar Rao has designed and\nbuilt India's first recycled shipping container home. Four recycled shipping containers, make up\nthe 90-square meter house.  The containers are stacked in an L shape to allow the air to move\nthrough naturally.  A wall made from recycled glass bottles brings more light into the hallway.\nPeople were unsure about how the house would deal with India’s extreme heat.  However, Rao\nand his family report that it’s as cool inside as the usual concrete and cement houses. Unlike\nusual houses, Rao’s house was completed in just four months, and at around $16,000 was built\nfor less than half of the usual local cost.  It could take time for the idea to be accepted by\ntraditionalists, but with his new business, Container Solutions, Rao has made it easier for Indians\nto build their own shipping container homes.<br/><b><br/></b><span style=\"font-size:8pt\"><b><sup>1\n</sup>urban slums: </b><i>n.<b> </b></i>poorer sections of cities<b><br/><sup>2</sup> building blocks:\n</b><i>n.</i> shaped pieces of wood or plastic used by children to build toy houses, etc.<b>\n<br/><sup>3 </sup>termites: </b><i>n.</i><b> </b>small insects that cause damage be eating\nwood<b><br/><sup>4</sup> versatile: </b><i>adj. </i>able to be used in several\nways<b><br/></b></span><br/><br/><br/><u>Cargotecture<br/>Paragraph 1. <br/></u>Main Topic -\n      The housing problem and one possible solution<br/>Details -\n      A.

Let’s go now to Africa, to Nigeria, to a\ncommunity called Makoko, a slum where 150,000 people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon. While\nit may appear to be a completely chaotic place, when you see it from above, there seems to be a whole\ngrid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home. From the main dock, people board long\nwooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area.\nWhen out on the water, it’s clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific\nway of living. Even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house, selling\nanything from toothpaste to fresh fruits. Behind every window and door frame, you’ll see a\nsmall child peering back at you, and while Makoko seems to be packed with people, what’s more\nshocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building. The population growth in\nNigeria, and especially in these areas like Makoko, are painful reminders of how out of control\nthings really are.<br/><br/>In Makoko, very few systems and infrastructures exist. Electricity is\nrigged, and freshest water comes from self-built wells throughout the area. This entire economic\nmodel is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water, so fishing and boat-making are\ncommon professions . . .</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
