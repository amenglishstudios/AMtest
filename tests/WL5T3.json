          "q": "Read the two paragraphs about polio. Synthesize the information. Organize your sentences logically and combine them into one continuous piece of writing. Do not forget to include your original ideas, too. Source A Polio* Poliomyelitis, often called polio or infantile paralysis, is an acute, viral, infectious disease spread from person to person. Although approximately 90 percent of polio infections cause no symptoms at all, affected individuals can exhibit a range of symptoms if the virus enters the blood stream. In about 1 percent of cases, the virus enters the central nervous system, infecting and destroying motor neurons, leading to muscle weakness and paralysis. Polio was first recognized as a distinct condition by Jakob Heine in 1840. Major polio epidemics started to appear in the late 19th century in Europe and soon after in the United States, and it became one of the most dreaded childhood diseases of the 20th century. Enhanced vaccination efforts hope to result in global eradication of the disease; however, in 2014 the World Health Organization declared a public health emergency due to outbreaks in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East. *Adapted from : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polio Source B Polio* Polio is an acute viral infectious disease of the nervous system that usually begins with general symptoms such as fever, headache, nausea, fatigue, and muscle pains. It is sometimes followed by a more serious and permanent paralysis of muscles in one or more limbs, the throat, or the chest. More than half of all cases of polio occur in children under the age of five. The paralysis that is commonly associated with the disease actually affects fewer than 1 percent of persons infected by the poliovirus. For those infected by the poliovirus, there is no cure. In the mid-20th century, hundreds of thousands of children were struck by the disease every year. Since the 1960s, thanks to widespread use of polio vaccines, polio has been eliminated from most of the world. It is now endemic in only three countries: Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. . *Adapted from: http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/467378/polio",
