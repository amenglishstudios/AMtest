But the project was abandoned when the construction company closed, and the building was never finished. However, local residents saw an opportunity. They began to turn the empty offices into apartments and stores. They painted the entrance and planted trees. As there were no working elevators, residents used taxis to reach the upper floors via the parking garage. Within a few years, 3,000 people were sharing a community that they built themselves. The abandoned tower, says photographer and TED speaker Iwan Baan, turned into &#8220;a living city.&#8221;<br><br><b>RECYCLED HOMES</b><br><br>In Huntsville, Texas, a community is building houses from recycled building materials. How did this start? Local builder and TED speaker Dan Phillips noticed that construction companies traditionally threw away large amounts of unused bricks, wood, and cement when they built homes. Phillips decided to work with local people and homeowners to build houses using these materials. These people are not professional builders, so Phillips teaches them the skills and techniques they need. The houses look different from normal houses. Phillips encourages the homeowners to be creative and make each house look unique.",

      "passage": "<b>Paragraph 1<br><br></b>There is an urgent need worldwide for good, affordable housing. More than 800 million people live in urban slums<sup>1</sup>. One possible solution for this problem is through &#8220;cargotecture&#8221;&#8212;using shipping containers to build houses and other structures. There are an estimated 17 million shipping containers moving cargo on ships, trucks, and trains. Around two million, however, sit unused. More goods are imported in shipping containers to some countries than are exported to other parts of the world, and in some cases, it is actually cheaper to build new containers than to ship them back empty. Shipping containers have long been used to provide emergency shelter after disasters, but in recent years, they have also been used to build everything from simple houses to shopping malls to high-rise student dormitories.<br><br><b>Paragraph 2<br><br></b>Shipping containers made of steel or aluminum are made to fit together, so they can be used as building blocks<sup>2</sup> to create all sorts of structures. They are more resistant to hurricanes, tornadoes and earthquakes than ordinary building materials. Recycling used containers as living spaces is environmentally friendly and inexpensive&#8212;they typically cost between US $1,000 and US $2,000 per container. They are fire proof and termite<sup>3</sup> proof. The containers can be converted in a central location, transported, and then assembled on-site, saving time and money. Containers are so versatile<sup>4</sup> that it is up to the architect whether to hide them or expose them, to use them as one part of a building or to design an entire building using them.<br><br><b>Paragraph 3<br><br></b>However, that doesn&#039;t mean they&#039;re perfect: The floors of the containers have often been treated with pesticides and other chemicals that were used to make them safe for transportation, so they have to be thoroughly cleaned and the floors covered. Converting them into usable structures can use a lot of energy. And individual containers are boxy and small. The containers typically come in two lengths, about 14 meters long and around 7 meters long, and are less than 3 meters wide and 3 meters high when insulation and interior walls are added. But architects and designers worldwide have managed to do a lot with them.<br><br><b>Paragraph 4<br><br></b>In the city of Bangalore, architect Kameshwar Rao has designed and built India's first recycled shipping container home. Four recycled shipping containers make up the 90-square-meter house. The containers are stacked in an L shape to allow the air to move through naturally. A wall made from recycled glass bottles brings more light into the hallway. People were unsure how the house would deal with India’s extreme heat. However, Rao and his family report that it’s as cool inside as the usual concrete and cement houses. Unlike usual houses, Rao’s house was completed in just four months, and at around $16,000 was built for less than half of the usual local cost. It could take time for the idea to be accepted by traditionalists, but with his new business, Container Solutions, Rao has made it easier for Indians to build their own shipping container homes.",

That was the challenge facing architects in Mexico City, where tall buildings are forbidden in order to preserve the city’s cultural heritage. The solution: Build an “Earthscraper.” The Earthscraper is a pyramid-shaped tower built upside-down and under the ground. Still in the planning stage, this innovative building will provide housing, office space, and cultural centers, says architect Emilio Barjau—without affecting the city’s historic downtown area.",

      "passage": "<b>Iwan Baan—Ingenious Homes in Unexpected Places</b><br><br>. . . Let’s go now to Africa, to Nigeria, to a community called Makoko, a slum where 150,000 people live just meters above the Lagos Lagoon. While it may appear to be a completely chaotic place, when you see it from above, there seems to be a whole grid of waterways and canals connecting each and every home. From the main dock, people board long wooden canoes which carry them out to their various homes and shops located in the expansive area. When out on the water, it’s clear that life has been completely adapted to this very specific way of living. Even the canoes become variety stores where ladies paddle from house to house, selling anything from toothpaste to fresh fruits. Behind every window and door frame, you’ll see a small child peering back at you, and while Makoko seems to be packed with people, what’s more shocking is actually the amount of children pouring out of every building. The population growth in Nigeria, and especially in these areas like Makoko, are painful reminders of how out of control things really are.<br><br>In Makoko, very few systems and infrastructures exist. Electricity is rigged, and fresh water comes from self-built wells throughout the area. This entire economic model is designed to meet a specific way of living on the water, so fishing and boat-making are common professions . . .",
