Photography is now so common, it is easy to forget that photographs - and the memories they hold - can be very precious.</p>\n\n<h4>Memory Archive</h4>\n<p>In a cold, windowless basement in Washington D.C., there is a man who knows the real value of a photograph. Since 1983, Bill Bonner has looked after National Geographic's photo archive. The archive holds around 8 million prints - many over 100 years old.</p>\n\n<p>In his long career, Bonner has looked at hundreds of thousands of photos. He believes each image holds a memory. Some record moments in history; others show \"people like us, just doing our thing, living our life.\" Even when forgotten by the outside world, these pictures still tell us much about the past.</p>\n\n<h4>Images From the Past</h4>\n<p>When the archive's earliest photos were taken, photography was difficult and expensive. Photographers needed special equipment and chemicals to develop pictures. Cameras were large and heavy - some weighed 20 pounds (9 kilos) or more. Early explorers used these massive cameras to photograph people and places most people had never seen.</p>\n\n<p>Photography expeditions took months or even years. \"They dedicated their lives to this,\" Bonner says. Many images are fragile, and he feels responsible for preserving them for people now and in the future. For Bonner, these figures from the distant past are almost like ancestors. \"It's like opening your grandparents' family album for the first time.\"</p>\n\narchive: a place that stores historical materials\n\ndevelop: to make a picture from film using special chemicals\n\nancestor: a relative who lived long ago",
