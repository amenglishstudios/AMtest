Photography is now so common, it is easy to forget that photographs - and the memories they hold - can be very precious.<\/p><h4>Memory Archive<\/h4><p>In a cold, windowless basement in Washington D.C., there is a man who knows the real value of a photograph. Since 1983, Bill Bonner has looked after National Geographic’s photo archive. The archive holds around 8 million prints - many over 100 years old.<\/p><p>In his long career, Bonner has looked at hundreds of thousands of photos. He believes each image holds a memory. Some record moments in history; others show \\\"people like us, just doing our thing, living our life.\\\" Even when forgotten by the outside world, these pictures still tell us much about the past.<\/p><h4>Images From the Past<\/h4><p>When the archive’s earliest photos were taken, photography was difficult and expensive. Photographers needed special equipment and chemicals to develop pictures. Cameras were large and heavy - some weighed 20 pounds (9 kilos) or more. Early explorers used these massive cameras to photograph people and places most people had never seen.<\/p><p>Photography expeditions took months or even years. \\\"They dedicated their lives to this,\\\" Bonner says. Many images are fragile, and he feels responsible for preserving them for people now and in the future. For Bonner, these figures from the distant past are almost like ancestors. \\\"It’s like opening your grandparents’ family album for the first time.\\\"<\/p><small><p><sup>1<\/sup> archive: a place that stores historical materials<\/p><p><sup>2<\/sup> develop: to make a picture from film using special chemicals<\/p><p><sup>3<\/sup> ancestor: a relative who lived long ago<\/p><\/small>",

      "passage": "<h2>Remember This<\/h2><p>There is a 41-year-old woman known as \\\"AJ,\\\" who remembers almost every day of her life since age 11. There is an 85-year-old man known as \\\"EP,\\\" who remembers only his most recent thought.<\/p><p>AJ remembers dates, events, weather, emotions — almost everything. Her ability is called <i>hyperthymestic syndrome<\/i>.<\/p><p>EP cannot make new memories. A virus in 1960 destroyed the medial temporal lobes in his brain, including the hippocampus. He remembers his childhood clearly, but nothing after 1960.<\/p><p>Alexander Luria, a Russian psychologist, once studied a man known as \\\"S\\\" who could remember almost everything. S could remember long lists of numbers and words with no difficulty. Another man, Kim Peek, could read two pages at the same time. Many people think Peek was the inspiration for the movie <i>Rain Man<\/i>.<\/p><p>AJ says she can remember each day of her life in great detail. If you say a date, she can tell you what day of the week it was, what she did, how she felt, and what the weather was like. \\\"She’s not easily stumped,\\\" the author writes. Scientists from the University of California have studied her for years. They have also studied EP to understand how memory works.<\/p><p>EP is like a digital camera without a working memory chip. He can see things, but he forgets them almost immediately. Scientists say that long-term memories are stored in the neocortex, which was not damaged by the virus. This is why EP can still remember his childhood.<\/p>",
