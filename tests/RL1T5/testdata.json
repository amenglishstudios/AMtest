Photography is now so common, it is easy to forget that photographs — and the memories they hold — can be very precious.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Memory Archive<\/h4>\n<p>In a cold, windowless basement in Washington D.C., there is a man who knows the real value of a photograph. Since 1983, Bill Bonner has looked after National Geographic’s photo archive. The archive holds around 8 million prints — many over 100 years old.<\/p>\n\n<p>In his long career, Bonner has looked at hundreds of thousands of photos. He believes each image holds a memory. Some of the pictures record moments in history. Many others, he says, show “people like us, just doing our thing, living our life.” Many of these memories have been forgotten by the outside world. But they still have the power to tell us a lot about the past.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Images From the Past<\/h4>\n<p>When the archive’s earliest photos were taken, photography was difficult and expensive. Photographers needed special equipment and chemicals to develop their pictures. Cameras were large and heavy — some weighed 20 pounds (9 kilos) or more. Early explorers used these massive cameras to photograph people and places that most people had never seen.<\/p>\n\n<p>Photography expeditions took several months, or even years. “They dedicated their lives to this,” Bonner says. Bonner feels responsible for keeping these memories alive, for people now and in the future. Many of the images are fragile, and he has to be very careful to preserve them. For Bonner, these figures from the distant past are almost like his ancestors. “For me,” he says, “it’s like opening your grandparents’ family album for the first time.”<\/p>\n\n<small>\n<p><sup>1<\/sup> archive: a place that stores historical materials<\/p>\n<p><sup>2<\/sup> develop: to make a picture from film using special chemicals<\/p>\n<p><sup>3<\/sup> ancestor: a relative who lived long ago<\/p>\n<\/small>",

      "passage": "<h2>Cesar Kuriyama — One Second Every Day<\/h2>\n\n<h4>Paragraph A<\/h4>\n<p>. . . So the first of those projects ended up being something I called “One Second Every Day.” Basically, I’m recording one second of every day of my life for the rest of my life, chronologically compiling these one-second tiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until, you know, I can’t record them anymore.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Paragraph B<\/h4>\n<p>The purpose of this project is, one: I hate not remembering things that I’ve done in the past. There’s all these things that I’ve done with my life that I have no recollection of unless someone brings it up, and sometimes I think, “Oh yeah. That’s something that I did.” And something that I realized early on in the project was that if I wasn’t doing anything interesting, I would probably forget to record the video. So the day—the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me, because it’s something that I really wanted to—from the moment that I turned 30, I wanted to keep this project going until forever, and having missed that one second, I realized, it just kind of created this thing in my head where I never forgot ever again.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Paragraph C<\/h4>\n<p>So if I live to see 80 years of age, I’m going to have a five-hour video that encapsulates 50 years of my life. When I turn 40, I’ll have a one-hour video that includes just my 30s. This has really invigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up, to try and do something interesting with my day.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Paragraph D<\/h4>\n<p>Now, one of the things that I have issues with is that, as the days and weeks and months go by, time just seems to start blurring and blending into each other and, you know, I hated that, and visualization is the way to trigger memory. You know, this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that I’ve done. Even just this one second allows me to remember everything else I did that one day. It’s difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second. On a good day, I’ll have maybe three or four seconds that I really want to choose, but I’ll just have to narrow it down to one, but even narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway.<\/p>\n\n<h4>Paragraph E<\/h4>\n<p>. . . One of the reasons that I took my year off was to spend more time with my family, and this really tragic thing happened where my sister-in-law, her intestine suddenly strangled one day, and we took her to the emergency room, and she was in really bad shape. We almost lost her a couple of times, and I was there with my brother every day. It helped me realize something else during this project, is that recording that one second on a really bad day is extremely difficult. It’s not—we tend to take our cameras out when we’re doing awesome things. Or we’re, “Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a picture.” But we rarely do that when we’re having a bad day, and something horrible is happening. And I found that it’s actually been very, very important to record even just that one second of a really bad moment. It really helps you appreciate the good times. It’s not always a good day, so when you have a bad one, I think it’s important to remember it, just as much as it is important to remember the [good] days.<\/p>",
