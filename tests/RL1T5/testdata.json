Photography is now so common, it is easy to forget that photographs - and the memories they hold - can be very precious.<\/p><h4>Memory Archive<\/h4><p>In a cold, windowless basement in Washington D.C., there is a man who knows the real value of a photograph. Since 1983, Bill Bonner has looked after National Geographic's photo archive. The archive holds around 8 million prints - many over 100 years old.<\/p><p>In his long career, Bonner has looked at hundreds of thousands of photos. He believes each image holds a memory. Some record moments in history; others show \\\"people like us, just doing our thing, living our life.\\\" Even when forgotten by the outside world, these pictures still tell us much about the past.<\/p><h4>Images From the Past<\/h4><p>When the archive's earliest photos were taken, photography was difficult and expensive. Photographers needed special equipment and chemicals to develop pictures. Cameras were large and heavy - some weighed 20 pounds (9 kilos) or more. Early explorers used these massive cameras to photograph people and places most people had never seen.<\/p><p>Photography expeditions took months or even years. \\\"They dedicated their lives to this,\\\" Bonner says. Many images are fragile, and he feels responsible for preserving them for people now and in the future. For Bonner, these figures from the distant past are almost like ancestors. \\\"It's like opening your grandparents' family album for the first time.\\\"<\/p><small><p><sup>1<\/sup> archive: a place that stores historical materials<\/p><p><sup>2<\/sup> develop: to make a picture from film using special chemicals<\/p><p><sup>3<\/sup> ancestor: a relative who lived long ago<\/p><\/small>",

      "passage": "<h2>Reading Comprehension Extension — Remember This<\/h2><p>There is a 41-year-old woman known as \\\"AJ,\\\" who remembers almost every day of her life since age 11. There is an 85-year-old man known as \\\"EP,\\\" who remembers only his most recent thought.<\/p><p>AJ remembers dates, events, weather, emotions — almost everything. Her ability is called <i>hyperthymestic syndrome<\/i>.<\/p><p>EP cannot make new memories. A virus in 1960 destroyed the medial temporal lobes in his brain, including the hippocampus. He remembers his childhood clearly, but nothing after 1960.<\/p><p>Psychologist Alexander Luria once studied a man who remembered every detail of every day — a reporter known only as \\\"S.\\\" Another well-known memory case is Kim Peek, the inspiration for the movie <i>Rain Man<\/i>. Peek could remember almost every word he ever read, but he could not button his own shirt.<\/p><p>AJ is different. She does not have savant skills; instead, she can recall personal events from decades ago as easily as if they happened yesterday. Scientists say she has one of the most extraordinary autobiographical memories ever recorded.<\/p><p>EP, on the other hand, forgets things seconds after they occur. He cannot form new long-term memories because his hippocampus was destroyed. Long-term memories are stored in the neocortex — which is why he still remembers his childhood — but without the hippocampus, nothing new can enter long-term storage.<\/p><p>EP sometimes believes the world is still the way it was decades ago. He once stated that gas prices were under a dollar and that the United States had not yet landed a man on the moon. Moments later, he forgot what he had just said.<\/p>",

Each second represents a small but meaningful moment from that day. Over time, these moments create a visual record of his life experiences.<\/p><h4>Paragraph B<\/h4><p>Kuriyama started the project after a year when he forgot much of what had happened. He realized that important memories were slipping away. By recording one second every day, he ensures that he will never forget the key moments of his life again.<\/p><h4>Paragraph C<\/h4><p>If he continues the project for the rest of his life, the final video will be hours long. If Kuriyama lives to the age of 80, his life movie will be approximately five hours in length, made up of one-second clips stitched together.<\/p><h4>Paragraph D<\/h4><p>Kuriyama says that choosing the one second for each day can sometimes be difficult. He wants each clip to represent something meaningful. The project forces him to reflect on his day and remember what mattered most, strengthening his ability to visualize and recall events.<\/p><h4>Paragraph E<\/h4><p>Kuriyama does not avoid recording difficult or sad moments. Even painful experiences, including a tragedy in his family, are part of his life story. Recording these moments helps him acknowledge and remember them instead of letting them fade away.<\/p>",
