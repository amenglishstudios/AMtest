She also\nhas autism. Some people view autism as a very limiting disability, but Grandin disagrees. She\nbelieves that if there were no autism in the world, we would “still be socializing in front of\na wood fire at the entrance to a cave ” Why? Grandin thinks that some people with autism have\nbrains that can solve problems “normal” brains cannot.<br/>No one knows for sure what\ncauses autism, but scientists believe it begins during the very early stages of brain development.\nAutism exists on a spectrum<sup>1</sup>—from very severe to moderate—and it affects\npeople in different ways. Often, people with autism have trouble socializing and communicating\nnormally with other people. For Grandin, autism also affects the way she thinks and understands the\nworld.<br/>VISUAL THINKER<br/>Grandin, like many people with autism, is a visual thinker—“I\nthink in pictures, not in language,” she says. For example, if you ask most people to think of\na shoe, they might “see” in their mind one or two shoes. Grandin, however, remembers all\nthe specific shoes that she knows and visualizes them in her mind. She says that her mind\n“works like Google Images.” Like Google, she can very quickly categorize the images and\narrange them in a specific order. She can also “animate” the images and make them into\nlittle movies.<br/>This ability to think visually has helped Grandin in her career. For example, she\nhas a unique understanding of how cattle think. According to animal researchers, cattle think in\npictures, not language—similar to how Grandin’s mind works. With this insight, she was\nable to design plans for livestock farms that reduce the fear that cattle may experience. For\nexample, cattle are easily distracted<sup>2</sup> and worried by things like waving flags or even a\nhose on the ground. Grandin’s designs take away those visual distractions, resulting in calmer\nlivestock.<br/>Grandin’s visual thinking means she can also picture how her designs might work.\nShe creates a mental simulation of her designs and does a test run of the equipment in her mind. She\nsays that the “normal brain ignores the details,” but her brain looks at every tiny\naspect of the design. She makes sure the system works even before it’s built.<br/>According to\nGrandin, an autistic mind is “a specialist mind—good at one thing, bad at something\nelse.” Her autism has made her an expert in animal welfare. She believes that other people with\nautism may be able to solve global problems or invent some incredible software. As she points out,\n“the world needs all kinds of minds.”<br/><sup>1</sup><b>spectrum</b>: <i>n. </i>a range\nof qualities, situations, etc.<br/><sup>2</sup><b>distracted</b>: <i>adj.</i> turn your attention away\nfrom something you want to concentrate on</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

When I asked people their associations with the wheelchair, they used\nwords like <i>limitation, fear, pity, </i>and <i>restriction</i>. I realized I’d internalized\nthese responses and it had changed who I was on a core level. A part of me had become alienated from\nmyself.
