No emails were sent out,\nand there was no website to check the date. And yet thousands of people went. “How do you do\nthat?” asks Simon Sinek.<br/>FOCUS ON BELIEFS<br/>Sinek, an author and consultant who studies\nleadership, has a theory about why some leaders are able to inspire others to action. He thinks that\ngreat leaders, above all, focus on what they believe. They answer questions like “What’s\nmy purpose? Why does my organization exist? Why do I get out of bed in the morning?” For\nexample, Martin Luther King Jr. stood out as a great leader because he told people what he \nbelieved—“I have a dream,” he said, not, “I have a plan.” Many people\nshared his belief that change was possible, and they decided to join him. <br/>If you talk about what\nyou believe, says Sinek, you will attract those who share the same beliefs. Most of us are followers,\nbut that does not mean we are unthinking<sup>1</sup> or easily led. Sinek suggests that we\ndon’t follow leaders because we have to, but because we want to. To illustrate this, he points\nout that thousands of people didn’t turn up for King himself, but for what he—and\nthey—believed in. “It’s what they  believed about America,” says Sinek,\n“that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in the middle of\nAugust.”<br/>Organizations, says Sinek, can also inspire followers by focusing on beliefs. The\nmost successful  businesses do more than just describe the features and benefits of their\nproducts. Apple, for instance, communicates its belief in thinking differently and challenging the\nway things are normally done. This helps to explain, says Sinek, why people stood in line for six\nhours when the first iPhone came out. They did  this not only because of the technology, but\nbecause they wanted to be part of a company they believed in.  In other words, says Sinek,\n“people don’t buy <i>what </i>you do, they buy <i>why </i>you do it.”<br/>NOT ALL\nLEADERS INSPIRE<br/>So we make our choices based on why companies and individuals do what they do.\nUnless we feel a real connection to the leaders in our lives—and share in their\nbeliefs—we won’t follow them. In the end, everyone wants to be part of something they\nbelieve in. “Because there are leaders and then there are those who lead,” says Sinek.\n“Leaders hold a position of power or authority, but those who lead inspire us [ . . .\n] We follow those who lead, not for them but for ourselves.” <br/><span style=\"font-size:9pt\"><sup>1</sup> <b>unthinking: </b><i>adj. </i>acting or speaking without thinking\nfirst</span></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
