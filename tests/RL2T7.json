She is particularly interested in nonverbal expressions\nof power. This is what our bodies do when we are—or feel—powerful. Cuddy believes that by\nchanging our body language, we can change how powerful we feel.<br/>To prove this point, she ran an\nexperiment. First, she invited a number of <u>candidates</u> to be interviewed for a job. Next,\nimmediately before the interview, Cuddy asked half the candidates to practice high-power poses for\ntwo minutes. The other candidates were asked to practice low-power poses for two minutes. Then the\ninterviews were filmed and later watched by a panel of interviewers who were not told what the\nexperiment was about. The panel judged the candidates who had practiced the high-power poses very\nfavorably. However, the interviewers did not want to hire anyone who had done the low-power\nposing.<br/>Cuddy gives a simple, biological explanation for <u>this</u>. She says that striking some\nposes releases particular chemicals in the brain. For low-power poses, these chemicals make people\nbelieve they are powerless. Feeling powerless, they often do not cope well with stress, and they are\nless positive. Conversely, Cuddy found that high-power poses release other chemicals in the brain.\nThese tell people that they are powerful, so they then feel confident. Interestingly, Cuddy found\nthat it didn’t matter what qualifications a candidate had, or even what he or she actually said\nin the interview. “It’s not about the <u>content</u> of the speech,” explains\nCuddy, “It’s about the presence that they’re bringing to the\nspeech.”<br/>Cuddy’s research suggests that doing a high-power pose for two\nminutes—even if we might look a bit silly when doing it—may make us feel more powerful.\nFeeling more powerful may very well make us believe we are more powerful. And that belief has the\npower to change our lives.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

But a new study suggests that body posture may be as important as the\nface in communicating emotions such as fear.  The study shows that images of fear affect the\nemotional part of the brain. Since the link between the emotional brain and action is stronger than\nthe link between the visual brain and action, viewing fearful body expressions may automatically\nprepare the observer to respond to fear.<br/>For the study, neuroscientist Beatrice de Gelder and her\ncolleagues used still images of 18 actors with their faces blocked out performing emotional actions\nlike opening a door and finding an armed robber standing in front of them. The actors also had to\nperform neutral actions like pouring water into a glass or combing their hair.  These images\nwere then shown to study participants inside a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machine that measured\nthe brain activity of the person watching the pictures.<br/>The researchers found that viewing happy\nbody postures increased activity only in brain regions that processed visual information. However,\nviewing fearful body postures activated brain regions that process emotional information, as well as\nthose that govern motor processes.<br/>The study shows that the brain's emotional response to\nfear is probably simpler and more automatic than some researchers have assumed in the past. At a\nfearful moment, animals and humans need to be response ready, since they are given only a fraction of\na second to evaluate the situation. <br/>Several teams around the world, including de Gelder's,\nare conducting experiments in which the brain activity of participants is scanned while they're\nwatching movies. This enables scientists to study how emotional actions are based on movement.<br/>In\nthe future, such research may help scientists diagnose mental diseases such as Alzheimer's and\ndisorders such as autism and schizophrenia. It may also be used in building robotic human companions,\nwhich could be improved by building principles of \"emotional movement\" into them.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

He believed that people have certain physiological responses when they lie.  Their\nbodies react differently when they lie compared to when they are telling the truth.  <br/>Larson\ntried out his invention on many people to compare normal responses (when a person is telling the\ntruth) to abnormal responses (when a person is lying). The polygraph worked by measuring a\nperson’s heart rate, blood pressure, breathing rate, and sweat production.  Sensors were\nattached to a person’s body, and the person was asked a series of questions. If their heart\nrate and blood pressure rose, they became sweaty and began breathing more rapidly, this indicated\nthat the person may be lying.  <br/>Larson’s tests were generally successful, and his\ninvention was named one of the world’s greatest inventions. Scientists aren’t completely\nconvinced of the test’s accuracy, however.  In some cases, a person may be telling the\ntruth but feel stress from the test. Their heart rate, blood pressure, etc. may rise even though they\nare not lying. The scientific community maintains that the polygraph is a useful but imperfect\ntool.<br/><br/><b><br/></b></div><div class=\"default\"><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"95%\"><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td width=\"4%\"><div class=\"choice\">a.</div></td><td width=\"96%\"><span class=\"default\">hypothesis</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">b.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">method</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">c.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">results</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">d.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">conclusion</span></td></tr></table></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
