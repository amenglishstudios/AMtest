But researchers are also\ndiscovering that other factors lie at the heart of student success.<br/>A recent Gallup poll in the\nU.S.A. found that over half of all high school students do not feel engaged with their studies. Why?\nResearchers think some students do not thrive in schools that focus on teacher-centered,\ntest-focused, and academic learning. These students often struggle to see the relationship between\nthis kind of learning and their lives. A report from the U.K. indicates that nearly a third of\nstudents do not complete their education because they don’t think their schooling is relevant\nto the kind of work they will do in the future.<br/>How can teenage students become more engaged?\nGeoff Mulgan, social commentator and TED speaker, believes the solution lies in making learning more\nrelevant. He researched how people learn in schools around the world, from Australia to Paraguay. His\nresearch suggested that a new model of schooling was needed—a model that connects what students\nare learning to their own plans for their future. “What kind of school would have teenagers\nfighting to get in, not fighting to stay out?” wondered Mulgan.<br/>LEARNING BY DOING<br/>Mulgan\nhelped create the Studio School, a system of publicly-funded schools for 14- to 19-year olds in the\nU.K. Unlike traditional education, Studio Schools combine academic learning with practical training\nfor future jobs. About 80 percent of the curriculum<sup>1</sup> is done not through sitting in\nclassrooms but through real-life, practical projects, including working at local businesses. Mulgan\npoints out that many teenagers “learn best in teams, and they learn best by doing things for\nreal.”<br/>This different approach is also enhanced by more personalized instruction and\nsupport. Studio Schools are smaller than traditional schools—typically around 300\nlearners—to ensure that every student feels valued and supported. Each student has a\n“personal coach” who helps him or her develop a plan to meet their learning goals. By\nhaving more tangible<sup>2</sup> goals, students become more determined to do well at school. Reports\nhave shown promising results. Many traditional-school students who were not getting good grades\nimproved significantly after they moved to a Studio School.<br/>Mulgan says Studio Schools are based\non a simple idea that turns education on its head. They put teamwork and practical projects at the\nheart of learning. This simple idea is spreading. From just one school in 2010, Studio Schools had\ngrown to <u>more than</u> 40 by 2014. <br/><sup>1</sup><b>curriculum</b>: <i>n</i>. the content and\nskills taught in a school or college course<br/><sup>2</sup><b>tangible</b>: <i>adj</i>. easy to see\nor recognize</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

Dr. Dweck has\nshown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to\nchallenge, they’re much more likely to persevere when they fail, because <u>they don’t\nbelieve that failure is a permanent condition.</u></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
