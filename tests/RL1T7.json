But in 2011, 13-year-old Rebecca Black’s song “Friday” became a sensation.\nBlack recorded the song as a music video for a small record company. The company posted it on\nYouTube. In its first month online, very few people saw it. Then a popular blogger wrote about the\nvideo. He called “Friday” the worst video ever made.<br/><br/><b>200 MILLION\nVIEWS<br/></b>Suddenly, the video went viral. Everyone wanted to see if “Friday” was\nreally so bad. People often watched the video on Friday. Soon, other people posted similar music\nvideos, inspired by “Friday.” For example, a famous comedian posted a video called\n“Thursday.” It had the same tune but different words. Its lyrics didn’t make sense\neither, but they were very funny. By the end of 2011, “Friday” had over 200 million\nviews. It was one of the most-watched videos on YouTube. Black was famous.<br/><br/><b>INSTANT\nFAME<br/></b>In the 21st century, our definition of fame has changed. Online video-sharing sites like\nYouTube make it possible for ordinary people—instead of movie companies or magazines, for\nexample—to decide who is famous. We all now have more ownership of our own pop culture, and\nno-one has to green-light our ideas—you can upload your own videos or publish your own work at\nany time. However, this fame may not be based on any actual talent. You could be famous for being a\nvery bad singer or just doing something ridiculous. For some people, this can mean that fame happens\nwhen we don’t expect it or even when we don’t want it. <br/><br/>Realistically, though,\nyour chances of becoming famous are still fairly small. In fact, 90 percent of videos viewed on\nYouTube are of people, like pop stars, who are already famous.<br/><br/><b></b></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

A fad catches on when the number of people following it\nincreases quickly. After a certain amount of time, however—it can be weeks, months, or\nyears—interest becomes less. It may not completely disappear, but it becomes far less intense.\nIn the Internet Age, people are so well-connected that a fad—such as the interest in viral\nvideos—can appear quickly and then disappear in the same amount of time. There were fads,\nhowever, long before the Internet existed.<br/><br/><div style=\"margin-left:3pt\"><b>Paragraph\n2<br/><br/></b>One example was the bicycle fad of the late 1800s. Early forms of the\nbicycle—called the velocipede—had appeared in the early part of the 19<sup>th</sup>\ncentury, but they were not very practical. One type of velocipede, introduced in France in 1865, was\nso uncomfortable to ride that it was called “the boneshaker.” The high-wheelers (called\n“penny-farthings” in the U.K.) of the early 1880s came next. These had one large wheel in\nfront—up to 64 inches (163 centimeters) in diameter—and a much smaller one in back. To be\nable to ride these not only took a lot of skill, but also cost a lot of money. A typical high-wheeler\ncost about the same as a six months’ salary for the average worker of the time. You also needed\nto be very brave, as accidents were common. The so-called “safety bicycle,” first\nmanufactured in Coventry, U.K. in 1885, looked much more like the bicycles we are familiar with\ntoday, and was the first machine to be called a “bicycle.”<br/><br/><b>Paragraph\n3<br/><br/></b>By the late 1880s, bicycling had become a huge fad in North America and Europe, and\n—unlike many fads—it had a lot of consequences. By 1890, there were around 300 bicycle\nfactories just in the U.S., and in that year, they made more than a million bicycles. Bicycles were\nused not only for basic transportation but also for leisure. The late 1800s was a time when the\nmiddle class started to have more free time. Bicycle races became popular. Bicycle clubs were formed\nand huge numbers of people would go for rides in the country on weekends. Bicyclists demanded that\nnational and local governments improve roads. Both men and women participated in the fad. As bicycles\nbecame safer and cheaper, more women had access to the personal freedom that bicycles gave them, and\nso the bicycle became a symbol of the “New Woman “of the late nineteenth\ncentury, especially in the U.K. and the U.S. It even changed women’s clothing. The long dresses\nwomen had worn prior to the fad were not suitable for bicycling, and “bicycle suits”\nbecame a common form of dress. <br/><br/><b>Paragraph 4<br/><br/></b>By about 1910, interest in bicycles\nbegan to decrease, as interest in cars and motorcycles grew. For the next 60 years, in the U.S. and\nEurope, bicycles were mainly used by children who were too young to drive. In the 1970s, bicycles\nwere rediscovered. Adults began to use them as a cheap, environmentally friendly alternative to cars.\nNew types of bicycles—such as mountain bikes—were used for recreation. This was the start\nof a new bicycle fad that continues to this very day.</div></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

I’m Kevin Allocca. I’m the trends manager at YouTube,\nand I professionally watch YouTube videos. It’s true. So we’re going to talk a little bit\ntoday about how videos go viral and then why that even matters. We all want to be stars—\ncelebrities, singers, comedians—and when I was younger, that seemed so very, very hard to do.\nBut now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become\ncompletely famous in a part of our world’s culture. Any one of you could be famous on the\nInternet by next Saturday. But there are over 48 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute. And\nof that, only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment.\nSo how does it happen? Three things: tastemakers, communities of participation, and unexpectedness.\n...<br/><br/> ... Last year, Bear Vasquez posted this video that he had shot outside his home in\nYosemite National Park. In 2010, it was viewed 23 million times. This is a chart of what it looked\nlike when it first became popular last summer. But he didn’t actually set out to make a viral\nvideo, Bear. He just wanted to share a rainbow. Because that's what you do when your name is\nYosemite Mountain Bear. And he had posted lots of nature videos in fact. . . .<br/><br/>And this video\nhad actually been posted all the way back in January. So what happened here? Jimmy Kimmel, actually.\nJimmy Kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would\nbecome. Because tastemakers like Jimmy Kimmel introduce us to new and interesting things and bring\nthem to a larger audience.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
