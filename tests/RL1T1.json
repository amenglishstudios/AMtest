Every month for a year, she decided to try two new activities. In February 2012, for example,\none of her goals was to eat less meat for 30 days. Later, she wrote a letter to a friend or relative\nevery day for a month. In just 12 months, she changed her life in more than 20 different\nways.<br/><br/><b>A YEAR OF CHANGE<br/></b><br/>Dunn was inspired to try her project after watching a TED\nTalk by Matt Cutts. To get ideas for activities, she watched hundreds of other TED Talks. Her first\nactivity, in November 2011, was inspired by Jessi Arrington’s talk “Wear Nothing\nNew.” Dunn tried each activity for 30 days, and then wrote about her experiences in a blog\ncalled “My Year of TED.”<br/><br/>Finally, when her project was over, Dunn talked about her\nexperiences at a TEDx conference in Hobart, Australia. Dunn’s talk in January 2014 inspired\nother people to change their attitudes and their lives. Before her project, Dunn says, she\ndidn’t think she had the courage to change her life. The project showed her she had more\nstrength than she thought.<br/><br/><b>A MILLION STORIES<br/><br/></b>“People who watch TED Talks .\n. . end up shifting their view of the future,” says Chris Anderson, the curator of TED. He says\nthat TED’s goal isn’t to make a single big change. TED’s impact is the millions of\nstories of small changes. Individual changes like Kylie Dunn’s are happening every day.\nTogether, these changes have the power to change the future in a positive way. As Anderson explains,\n“Instead of thinking of [the future] as an unstoppable force . . . [people\ncan] play a part in shaping it.”<br/><div style=\"margin-left:31pt;margin-right:63pt\"><b><br/></b></div><div style=\"margin-right:63pt\"><span style=\"font-size:9pt\"><b>courage: </b><i>n</i>. a willingness to do something that is difficult or\ndangerous<br/></span></div><div style=\"margin-right:93pt\"><span style=\"font-size:9pt\"><b>shifting:\n</b><i>v</i>. moving, changing<br/><b>view:  </b><i>n</i>. an opinion or way of thinking about\nsomething<br/></span></div><div style=\"margin-right:0pt\"><span style=\"font-size:9pt\"><b>curator:\n</b><i>n</i>. a person who selects and manages a collection of art, videos, etc.<br/><br/></span><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"></span></div></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

He is probably best known for his 2004 documentary\nfilm<sup>1</sup>, <i>Supersize Me</i>. This movie probably changed the eating habits of millions of\npeople. After seeing this film, I don’t believe anyone could look at fast food in the same\nway.  In the movie, Spurlock does an experiment: For 30 days, he eats three meals a day from\nMcDonald’s, and nothing else. His diet caused him shocking physical and emotional problems. He\nwas healthy and fit when he started his experiment. In 30 days, he gained 11 kg (25 pounds). He also\nhad liver problems and became depressed. It took him over a year to return to his normal weight of 84\nkg (185 pounds) and become healthy again. Spurlock was nominated for an Academy Award<sup>2</sup> for\nbest documentary film that year—an award that he should have won.  <br/><br/>A few years\nlater, Spurlock produced a television series called <i>30 Days</i>.  In this series, someone\n(often Spurlock himself) lives the life of someone else. For example, in one episode, he stays in a\nprison for 30 days. In another, he works as a coal miner for 30 days. Not everyone agrees that 30\ndays is enough to really know what it was like to be in prison, or to mine coal, or to understand\nanother person’s lifestyle. However, his shows gave us a glimpse<i><sup>3</sup></i> into\ndangerous and unfamiliar ways of living,<br/> <br/><span style=\"font-size:10pt\"><sup>1</sup>\n<b>documentary films: </b><i>n.</i> factual movies about real people and real events<br/><sup>2\n</sup><b>the Academy Awards:</b> <i>n.</i> prizes given every year for the best movie, best director,\nbest actor, etc. (also called “the Oscars”)<br/><sup>3</sup><b>glimpse:</b> <i>n.</i> a\nquick look</span></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

I decided to\nfollow in the footsteps of the American film-maker, Morgan Spurlock, and to try something new for 30\ndays. The idea is actually pretty simple. Think about something you’ve always wanted to add to\nyour life. Then try it for the next 30 days. It turns out, 30 days is just about the right amount of\ntime to add a new habit or subtract a habit from your life.<br/><br/>There are a few things I learned\nwhile doing these 30-day challenges. The first thing I learned is that the months didn’t fly\nby, forgotten. Instead, the time was much more memorable. One  challenge was to take a picture\nevery day for a month. And I remember exactly where I was and what I was doing each day I took a\nphoto.. I also noticed that, as I started to do harder 30-day challenges, my self-confidence grew. I\nwent from being a computer nerd1 to the kind of guy who bikes to work—for fun. And last year, I\nhiked up Mt. Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain in Africa. I would never have been that adventurous\nbefore I started my 30-day challenges.<br/><br/>I also figured out that if you really want something\nbadly enough, you can do anything for 30 days. Have you ever wanted to write a novel? Every November,\ntens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel in 30 days. All you have to do\nis write 1,667 words a day for a month. So I did. By the way, the secret is not to go to sleep until\nyou’ve written your words for the day. You might not get enough  sleep, but you’ll\nfinish your  novel. Now, is my book the next great American novel? No. I wrote it in a month.\nIt’s awful. But for the rest of my life, I don’t have to say, “I’m a computer\nscientist” Now, if I want to, I can say, “I’m a novelist.”<br/><br/>So\nhere’s my question to you: What are you waiting for? I guarantee you the next 30 days are going\nto pass whether you like it or not, so why not think about something you have always wanted to try,\nand give it a shot for the next 30 days.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
