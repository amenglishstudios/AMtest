It used to be a\ngrocery store. But now it is vacant. On the boards covering the windows are stickers. Each sticker\nsays “I wish this was . . . ” Someone has written “full of food” on one of\nthe stickers. <br/><br/>When we think of public art, we often think of sculptures or other large works\nof art in city centers. Candy Chang’s art, however, is somewhere else. Chang makes her art in a\ncity’s older or poorer neighborhoods. She uses the outside walls of vacant buildings as her\ncanvas. She paints, writes messages, or puts stickers on them. Chang wants to reach out to people\nwith her art. She sees it as the start of a conversation—a conversation with local residents.\n<br/><br/>In 2010, Chang started the “I Wish This Was” project in New Orleans. Chang asked\nresidents to look at the abandoned buildings in their community. She wanted them to think about what\nelse could be there. She printed hundreds of small stickers and stuck them on these buildings. The\nstickers said, “I wish this was” in large letters and included a space for people to\nwrite. Anyone could write anything. Chang was amazed at the reaction. Hundreds of residents wrote on\nthe stickers. Someone wrote, “I wish this was a grocery store.” Another person wrote,\n“I wish this was Heaven.” <br/><br/>There are many abandoned buildings in neighborhoods\naround the world. It’s hard for residents to create a close neighborhood if the streets are\nfull of empty buildings. By making art that gives residents a voice, Chang hopes to build stronger\ncommunities. Chang’s art projects get residents thinking and talking about problems in their\ncommunity. This initiative may help city planners to create better cities—ones that truly meet\nthe needs of residents.<br/><br/><b></b></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

It sits on\ntop of a massive landfill<sup>1</sup> that receives 1,500 tons of new trash each day. The village is\nhome to several thousand families who make a living by sorting through the waste, separating out\nwhatever is useful or whatever can be sold to the local recycling industry. According to\nUNICEF<sup>2</sup>, Cateura is a community with extreme poverty, illiteracy, and pollution.\nAmazingly, it’s also home to an orchestra—one made up of local children whose instruments\nare made entirely from recycled trash.<br/><b><br/>Paragraph B</b><br/>“Los Reciclados,” or\nThe Recycled Orchestra, was formed several years ago when environmentalist and musician Favio\nChávez decided to open a music school. He partnered with a local garbage picker Nicolás\nGómez—a genius at building useful things from trash. There was no money for real\ninstruments, so together they made instruments from the trash around them. Oil drums became violins\nand cellos, water pipes and bottle caps turned into flutes, and packing crates grew into guitars. The\nfact that the instruments are made from recycled trash has a practical purpose as well: The kids can\nsafely carry them. For many children, it was impossible to give them a violin to take home because\nthey had nowhere to keep it and their parents were afraid they would be robbed. A real violin would\nbe worth more than a house in Cateura.   <br/><b><br/>Paragraph C</b><br/>Chávez started\ntraining just a few children, but today the orchestra is made up of 35 kids from Cateura. Chávez\ngives music lessons to another 200, who also learn how to build their own recycled instruments.\nCateura may seem like the unlikeliest of homes for a classical music community. But for the children\nwho’ve come to love it, music has given them a greater purpose. These ingenious musicians have\nmanaged to transform their reality into beautiful symphonies by Mozart and Beethoven. As one young\nmusician says, “My life would be worthless without music.”<br/><b><br/>Paragraph\nD</b><br/>The Recycled Orchestra has become the focus of international attention over the last few\nyears. It is the subject of a documentary film about the kids, <i>Landfill Harmonic</i>, which has\ngone viral. The orchestra has gone on a tour of several South American countries, with plans to tour\nsoon in the U.S. and Europe. Meanwhile, Chávez will continue his work in Cateura. \"Sports\ncan be competitive. Music causes children to connect and feel they are building something together.\nOur orchestra feels special because the children make beauty out of garbage.\"<br/><br/><span style=\"font-size:9pt\"><sup>1 </sup><b>landfill</b>: <i>n. </i>a place where garbage is buried in the\nground<br/><sup>2</sup> <b>UNICEF</b>: United Nations Children’s Fund<br/><br/></span><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"></span></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

There are also well-known murals<sup>1</sup>. One of the most interesting of\nthese is called “How to Turn Anything into Something Else.” It was created by 31\nstudents, ages 10–15. The students worked with a group of artists from a nationally known art\ncollective. They helped the students access their own imaginations.<br/><br/>The students took a piece\nof paper and drew the head of an animal at the top. When they had finished drawing it, they folded\nthe paper so that only the neck of their drawing was visible. Then it was passed to the next student,\nwho drew a torso<sup>2</sup> of an animal. The folding and passing was repeated until an entire\ncreature was drawn on the paper. This exercise was designed to show students that art does not have\nto end the way it begins. The students created hundreds of images over the summer.
