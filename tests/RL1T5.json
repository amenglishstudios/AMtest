Photography is now so common, it is easy to forget that photographs—and the memories\nthey hold—can be very precious.<br/><br/>MEMORY ARCHIVE<sup>1</sup><br/><br/>In a cold, windowless\nbasement in Washington D.C., there is a man who knows the real value of a photograph. Since 1983,\nBill Bonner has looked after National Geographic’s photo archive. The archive holds around 8\nmillion prints—many over 100 years old.<br/><br/>In his long career, Bonner has looked at\nhundreds of thousands of photos. He believes each image<b> </b>holds a memory. Some of the pictures\nrecord<b> </b>moments in history. Many others, he says, show “people like us, just doing our\nthing, living our life.” Many of these memories have been forgotten by the outside world. But\nthey still have the power to tell us a lot about the past.<br/><br/>IMAGES FROM THE PAST<br/><br/>When\nthe archive’s earliest photos were taken, photography was difficult and expensive.\nPhotographers needed special equipment<b> </b>and chemicals to develop<sup>2</sup> their pictures.\nCameras were large and heavy—some weighed 20 pounds (9 kilos) or more. Early explorers used\nthese massive cameras to photograph people and places that most people had never\nseen.<br/><br/>Photography expeditions took several months, or even years. “They dedicated their\nlives to this,” Bonner says. Bonner feels responsible for keeping these memories alive, for\npeople now and in the future. Many of the images are fragile, and he has to be very careful to\npreserve them. For Bonner, these figures from the distant past are almost like his\nancestors<sup>3</sup>. “For me,” he says, “it’s like opening your\ngrandparents’ family album for the first time.”<br/><br/><span style=\"font-size:8pt\"><sup>1</sup><b>archive</b>: <i>n.</i> a place that stores historical\nmaterial<br/><sup>2</sup><b>develop</b>: <i>v.</i> to make a photograph using a special\nprocess<br/><sup>3</sup><b>ancestor</b>: <i>n.</i> someone related to you who lived in the\npast<br/><br/></span><span style=\"font-size:12pt\"></span></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

There is an 85-year-old man, a retired lab technician called \"EP,\"\nwho remembers only his most recent thought. She might have the best memory in the world. He could\nvery well have the worst.<br/><br/>\"My memory flows like a movie—nonstop and\nuncontrollable,\" says AJ. She remembers that at 12:34 p.m. on Sunday, August 3, 1986, a young\nman she knew called her on the telephone.  She remembers that on March 28, 1992, she had lunch\nwith her father at the Beverly Hills Hotel. She remembers world events and trips to the grocery\nstore, the weather and her emotions. Virtually every day is there. She’s not easily\nstumped.<br/><br/>There have been a few people over the years with extremely good memories. Kim Peek is\nsaid to have memorized nearly 12,000 books (he reads a page in 8 to 10 seconds). \"S,\" a\nRussian journalist who was studied for 30 years by the Russian psychologist Alexander Luria, could\nremember impossibly long strings of words and numbers years after he'd first heard them. But AJ\nis unique. Her amazing memory is not for facts or figures, but for her own life. Indeed, her memory\nis so unusual and so poorly understood that scientists who have been studying her for the past seven\nyears had to think of a new medical term to describe her condition: hyperthymestic\nsyndrome.<br/><br/>EP is friendly and easy to talk to. He laughs a lot. But in 1960, a virus destroyed\nthe medial temporal lobes in his brain, and with them most of EP's memory. The medial temporal\nlobes—there's one on each side of the brain—include a part called the hippocampus\nthat turns our experiences into long-term memories. The memories aren't actually stored in the\nhippocampus—they stay somewhere else, in the brain's outer layer, the neocortex—but\nthe hippocampus area is the part of the brain that makes them stick. EP's hippocampus was\ndestroyed, and without it he is like a digital camera without a working memory chip. He sees, but he\ndoesn't record.<br/><br/>EP can't make new memories, and he can't remember old memories\neither, at least not since 1960. His childhood, his service in World War II—all that is\nperfectly clear to him. But to him, gas still costs less than a dollar a gallon, and the moon landing\nnever happened.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

The area with the highest number of selfies per person was Makati City, which is the financial center of Manila in the Philippines. The population of Makati City is about 1.5 million people. People there took nearly 260 selfies per 100,000 persons. Next came Manhattan, a part of New York City. The population of Manhattan is just under 400,000. In Manhattan, people took approximately 200 photos of themselves per 100,000 residents.

So the first of those projects ended up\nbeing something I called “One Second Every Day.” Basically, I’m recording one\nsecond of every day of my life for the rest of my life, chronologically compiling these one-second\ntiny slices of my life into one single continuous video until, you know, I can’t record them\nanymore.<br/><br/><b>Paragraph B<br/><br/></b>The purpose of this project is, one: I hate not remembering\nthings that I’ve done in the past. There’s all these things that I’ve done with my\nlife that I have no recollection of unless  someone brings it up, and sometimes I think,\n“Oh yeah. That’s something that I did.” And something that I realized early on in\nthe project was that if I wasn’t doing anything interesting, I would probably forget to record\nthe video. So the day—the first time that I forgot, it really hurt me, because it’s\nsomething that I really wanted to—from the moment that I turned 30, I wanted to keep this\nproject going  until forever, and having missed that one second, I realized, it just kind of\ncreated this thing in my head where I never forgot ever again.<br/><br/><b>Paragraph C<br/><br/></b>So if\nI live to see 80 years of age, I’m going to have a five- hour video that encapsulates 50 years\nof my life. When I turn 40, I’ll have a one-hour video that includes just my 30s. This has\nreally invigorated me day-to-day, when I wake up, to try and do something interesting with my\nday.<br/><br/><b>Paragraph D<br/><br/></b><div style=\"margin-right:0pt\">Now, one of the things that I\nhave issues with is that, as the days and weeks and months go by, time just seems to start blurring\nand blending into each other and, you know, I hated that, and visualization is the way to trigger\nmemory. You know, this project for me is a way for me to bridge that gap and remember everything that\nI’ve done. Even just this one second allows me to remember everything else I did that one day.\nIt’s difficult, sometimes, to pick that one second. On a good day, I’ll have maybe three\nor four seconds that I really want to choose, but I’ll just have to narrow it down to one, but\neven narrowing it down to that one allows me to remember the other three anyway.<br/><br/><b>Paragraph\nE<br/><br/></b></div><div style=\"margin-right:11pt\">. . . One of the reasons that I took my year off\nwas to spend more time with my family, and this really tragic thing happened where my sister-in-law,\nher intestine suddenly strangled one day, and we took her to the emergency room, and she was, she was\nin really bad shape. We almost lost her a couple of times, and I was there with my brother every day.\nIt helped me realize something else during this project, is that recording that one second on a\nreally bad day is extremely difficult. It’s not—we tend to take our cameras out when\nwe’re doing awesome things. Or we’re, “Oh, yeah, this party, let me take a\npicture.” But we rarely do that when we’re having a bad day, and something horrible is\nhappening. And I found that it’s actually been very, very important to record even just that\none second of a really bad moment. It really helps you appreciate the good times. It’s not\nalways a good day, so when you have a bad one, I think it’s important to remember it, just as\nmuch as it is important to remember the [good] days.<br/><br/></div></div><div class=\"default\"><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"95%\"><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td width=\"4%\"><div class=\"choice\">a.</div></td><td width=\"96%\"><span class=\"default\">Paragraph A</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">b.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">Paragraph B</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">c.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">Paragraph\nC</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">d.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">Paragraph D</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">e.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">Paragraph E</span></td></tr></table></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
