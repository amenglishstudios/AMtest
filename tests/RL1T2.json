Try the\n“Marshmallow Challenge”!<br/><br/>The Marshmallow Challenge is a team game. The goal is to\nbuild the tallest tower you can in 18 minutes. You don’t have to use all the spaghetti, string,\nor tape, but the marshmallow must be at the top of the tower. The tower has to stand up by itself\nwithout any support. The team with the highest tower wins the challenge.<br/><br/>The idea for the\nactivity came from a designer named Peter Skillman. Skillman’s idea inspired another designer,\nTom Wujec. Wujec thought the activity might be a great way to learn how people collaborate, or work\ntogether, better. <br/><br/>Wujec noticed that the best teams have three different kinds of people in\nthem: experts, organizers, and experimenters. The experts know how to build strong structures. For\nexample, they tape the spaghetti into small triangle shapes because triangles are stable. The\norganizers know how to plan a project. They help the team complete the project on time. The\nexperimenters build lots of different towers. They try different prototypes until they find the right\none. <br/><br/>Wujec has held more than 70 Marshmallow Challenges around the world—many with\nbusiness people. Wujec realized that if business people work better as a team, they make better\nproducts or provide better services. As he says, “Every project has its own marshmallow.”\nWith a simple team game, business workers and other groups of people can learn how to collaborate\nbetter and become more successful. <br/><br/><b>prototype</b>: <i>n. </i>a model that you make before\nbuilding something</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

So you will have\ntwo.\"<br/><br/>So what happened when the professor left the room? As soon as the door\nclosed... two out of three ate the marshmallow.  Couldn't do it. Could not\nwait. What's interesting is that one out of three would look at the marshmallow and go\nlike this ... Would look at it. Put it back. They would walk around . . .<br/><br/>That child\nalready, at four, understood the most important principle for success, which is the ability\nto delay gratification<sup>2</sup>. Self-discipline: the most important factor for\nsuccess. 15 years later, 14 or 15 years later, follow-up study. What did they\nfind? They went to look for these kids who were now 18 and 19. And they found that 100\npercent of the children that had not eaten the marshmallow were successful. They had good\ngrades. They were doing wonderful. They were happy. They had their plans. They had good\nrelationships with the teachers, students. They were doing fine.<br/><br/>A great percentage of\nthe kids that ate the marshmallow, they were in trouble. They did not make it to\nuniversity. They had bad grades. Some of them dropped out. A few were still there with bad\ngrades. A few had good grades.<br/><br/>And this applies for everything. Even in sales. The sales\nperson that—the customer says, \"I want that.\" And the person says, \"Okay, here\nyou are. \"That person ate the marshmallow. If the sales person says, \"Wait a second. Let me\nask you a few questions to see if this is a good choice.\" Then you sell a lot more.

(F) Too often, managers choose these types of activities with no real plan or goal\nin mind. (G) This tends to be a waste of time. (H) Team-building activities can be a powerful way to\nunite a group and develop strengths, but only if the exercises are well-planned and have specific\ngoals.<br/><br/><b>Paragraph 2</b><br/><br/>(A) The most important step when planning a team-building\nactivity comes at the very beginning: Managers must start by figuring out what challenges their team\nfaces. (B) Only then can they choose exercises that will be effective in helping them solve their\nproblems. (C) Managers should therefore spend time thinking about their team's current\nweaknesses. (D) For example, are there conflicts between certain people that cause divisions within\nthe team? (E) Does poor communication slow the group's progress?

(F) Office team-building works on\nthe same principle—it needs to happen continuously for the group to be successful. (G) Most\nmanagers plan one or two events per year, and that's it.

So, normally, most people begin by orienting themselves to\nthe task. They talk about it, they figure out what it’s going to look like, they jockey for\npower. Then they spend some time planning, organizing, they sketch, and they lay out spaghetti. They\nspend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever-growing structures. And then,\nfinally, just as they’re running out of time, someone takes out the marshmallow, and then they\ngingerly<sup>1</sup> put it on top, and then they stand back, and—<i>\n</i>ta-da!<sup>2</sup>—they admire their work. But what really happens, most of the time, is\nthat the “ta-da” turns into an“uh-oh,”<sup>3  </sup>because the weight\nof the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse.<br/><br/>So the average for\nmost people is around 20 inches; business school students, about half of that; lawyers, a little\nbetter, but not much better than that; kindergarteners, better than most adults. Who does the very\nbest? Architects and engineers, thankfully. Thirty-nine inches is the tallest structure I’ve\nseen. And why is it? Because they understand triangles and self-reinforcing geometrical patterns are\nthe key to building stable structures. So CEOs, a little bit better than average, but here’s\nwhere it gets interesting. If you put an executive administrator on the team, they get significantly\nbetter. It’s incredible. You know, you look around, you go, “Oh, that team’s going\nto win.” You can just tell beforehand. And why is that? Because they have special skills of\nfacilitation<sup>4</sup>. They manage the process, they understand the process. And any team who\nmanages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team’s performance.\nSpecialized skills and facilitation skills are the combination that leads to strong success. If you\nhave ten teams that typically perform, you’ll get maybe six or so that have standing\nstructures. . . .<br/> <br/><sup>1</sup><b> gingerly</b>: <i>adv. </i>very carefully  \n<br/><sup>2</sup> <b>ta-da</b>:  <i>exclam. </i>a sound people make to indicate\nsuccess<br/><sup>3</sup> <b>uh-oh</b>: <i>exclam. </i>a sound people make to indicate\nfailure<br/><sup>4</sup> <b>facilitation</b>: <i>n. </i>making something run smoothly</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
