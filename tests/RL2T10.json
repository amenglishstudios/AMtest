Journalist David McCandless thinks that the solution lies in\nwell-designed visuals that can help us make sense of a complex world.<br/>“There’s\nsomething almost quite magical about visual information,” says David McCandless. He and his\nteam use software to scrape—collect—data from lots of different sources online. They try\nto find hidden connections, patterns, and stories that connect the pieces of data. Then they create\n<u>infographics</u> that people might find interesting and useful. Also, as McCandless says,\ninfographics can “just look cool!”<br/>For example, a world map usually represents the\nsize of countries by land area. But what does the world look like if we see nations according to\ntheir population size, or how much they consume? This kind of visual not only helps us understand the\nworld better; it can also change our perspective about it. By connecting different data, we can get a\nmore complete picture of the world.<br/>According to McCandless, by visualizing information, we turn\nit into a landscape that we can explore with our eyes—“a sort of information map? ”\nAs McCandless explains, the human  eye easily notices and appreciates visual patterns.\nMcCandless calls patterns the “language of the eye.” On the other hand, words and numbers\nare the “language of the mind.” McCandless believes that if you combine patterns with\nwords and numbers, you can speak two languages at the same time, “each enhancing the\nother.”<br/>The solution to information overload, according to McCandless, is using our eyes\nmore. By visualizing information, we can understand it better. McCandless compares the act of reading\na large amount of data to the experience of finding your way through the wilderness. When you come\nacross a beautiful graphic, he says, it’s a relief. “It’s like coming across a\nclearing in the jungle.”</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

Instead of reading a million-word text and trying to summarize the\ninformation, an infographic does the work for you. It highlights important information and organizes\nit in an attractive way. Its combination of colors, numbers, text, shapes, and pictures tells a\nvisual story.  <br/>In today’s high-tech society, people are accustomed to constant visual\n<u>stimuli</u>. Commercials on TV use many visual images to communicate information in a short period\nof time: bright colors, attractive actors, large letters, etc. Websites have flashing ads, numerous\ntabs for people to click on, photos, different kinds of font types, etc. Without these images, a page\nor screen may appear boring. <u>We</u> might not have the patience to read something if there is\nnothing visually stimulating about it.<br/>This is where infographic designers come in. They have the\ndifficult task of making information come alive. Infographic designers have to be good at math and\nart. They can simplify complicated research data as well as make it visually attractive. Pages and\npages of <u>statistics</u> (numbers, percentages, dates, etc.) can be dull and mean nothing to the\naverage reader.  But <u>consolidate</u> these pages into <u>one</u>, add some pictures and a few\nwell-placed words, and suddenly your average reader is interested in what information is being\ncommunicated.  <br/>Companies hire infographic designers to create materials for educational or\nmarketing purposes. For example, one infographic could be used to show how taxes affect people at\ndifferent income levels (educational). Another could be used to show how a hair-care product compares\nto other similar products (marketing).  With people’s needs for visual stimulation and\ncompanies’ needs to educate the public or market their products, infographic designers will\nhave a steady job for many years to come.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

It’s not a particularly great metaphor in these times, especially if you live around\nthe Gulf of Mexico, but I would, perhaps, adapt this metaphor slightly, and I would say that data is\nthe new soil. Because for me, it feels like a fertile, creative medium. Over the years, online,\nwe’ve laid down a huge amount of information and data, and we irrigate it with networks and\nconnectivity, and it’s been worked and tilled by unpaid workers and governments. And, all\nright, I’m kind of milking the metaphor a little bit. But it’s a really fertile medium,\nand it feels like visualizations, infographics, data visualizations, they feel like flowers blooming\nfrom this medium. But if you look at it directly, it’s just a lot of numbers and disconnected\nfacts. But if you start working with it and playing with it in a certain way, interesting things can\nappear and different patterns can be revealed.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
