He estimates that wind has more than enough power to provide for\nour global energy needs 200 times over. Now, an idea from a child’s toy may help to\nharness<sup>1</sup> this power.<br/>Towering 300 feet (90 meters) above the Earth’s surface,\nwind turbines are the most visible—and common—way to harness the power of the wind. Wind\npower is becoming an important source of energy today. Population growth means we have a greater need\nfor energy, especially energy that does not add to global warming. According to the U.S. Department\nof Energy, one megawatt of wind energy can provide power for up to 400 homes without producing any\ncarbon dioxide—a source of global warming.<br/>While wind is a promising energy source, there\nare problems with traditional turbines. First of all, they’re expensive. This is because\nthey’re made from costly materials such as steel and fiberglass<sup>2</sup>. In addition,\nthey’re only useful in places where the wind travels routinely at around 15–20 miles per\nhour. Only about 15 percent of land in the world has winds this strong. Turbines are already very\ntall, but to reach the faster wind speeds at even higher altitudes, they would have to be taller. But\nat the moment, it’s not practical to build these taller turbines.<br/>Inventor Saul Griffith got\nan idea from a wind-powered toy—the kite—to solve some of these problems. Griffith is\ndeveloping an “energy kite,” that is tethered<sup>3</sup> to the ground. It flies in\nlarge circles up to 1,000 feet (300 meters) in the air. At this altitude, the wind is stronger and\nmore consistent than at lower altitudes. The energy kite has blades like a regular turbine, so it\ngenerates electricity in a similar way.<br/>Griffith’s invention has some advantages over a\ntraditional turbine. First of all, it’s lighter. For example, the shaft is made of plastic,\nwhich is cheap to make. It can also generate more than twice as much wind power as a traditional\nturbine. Finally, because most of the energy kite is in the air, it takes up less land than a\ntraditional turbine. It also works over water, where wind moves at even greater speeds.<br/>Griffith\nsays his invention has brought us to “the dawn of a new age of kites. ” He and his team\nare planning even bigger energy kites that could generate huge amounts of clean electricity. While he\nis still at the prototype stage, the early tests are promising. Griffith believes his energy kite\nwill be an important part of the solution to our current climate and energy\nproblems.<br/><b><sup>1</sup>harness</b>: <i>v</i>. to capture the power of\nsomething<br/><b><sup>2</sup>fiberglas</b>s: <i>n.</i> a material made from glass\nfibers<br/><b><sup>3</sup>tether</b>: <i>v.</i> to hold in place using a rope</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

Nuclear energy and wind power seem to be very different in terms of how much energy they\nproduce, and how safe people perceive them to be.  <br/>One nuclear power plant produces the same\namount of electricity per year as over 2000 wind turbines. An average wind farm has about 30\nturbines. This works out to 60 wind farms per one nuclear power plant. A nuclear power plant is\ncapable of producing energy constantly, whereas wind turbines require the right weather conditions to\nbe effective. In terms of being a reliable source of electricity, nuclear power has the\nadvantage.<br/>However, nuclear power is perceived to be much more dangerous. If there is some kind of\nleak or explosion, nuclear power plants can release harmful radioactive particles into the air. \nThese particles can cause cancer or other illnesses. People are required to live one mile away from a\nnuclear power plant. In case of an accident, people who live within 50 miles of the plant are\n<u>evacuated</u>.<br/>This is in contrast to the relatively safe wind farms. There is no risk of\nradiation from a wind turbine. The biggest problem may be the noise the turbines produce. Researchers\nare finding that long-term exposure to such noise can cause hearing damage. But in general, it would\nbe much safer to live next to a wind farm than a nuclear power plant.<br/>Neither source of energy is\nperfect though scientists seek to improve upon them.  Technological advances have made nuclear\npower plants safer. Inventors, like Saul Griffith,” are attempting to harness wind power more\neffectively through devices such as the “energy kite.” Perhaps over time, the two sources\nwill be equally safe and efficient.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

Two years ago, I stood on\nthe TED stage in Arusha, Tanzania. I spoke very briefly about one of my proudest creations. It was a\nsimple machine that changed my life.<br/>Before that time, I had never been away from my home in\nMalawi. I had never used a computer. I had never seen an Internet. On the stage that day, I was so\nnervous. My English lost, I wanted to vomit. I had never been surrounded by so many azungu, white\npeople. <br/>One year, our fortune turned very bad. In 2001, we experienced an awful famine. Within\nfive months all Malawians began to starve to death. My family ate one meal per day, at night. Only\nthree swallows of <i>nsima</i> for each one of us. The food passes through our bodies. We drop down\nto nothing.<br/>. . . Another book put that knowledge in my hands. It said a windmill could pump water\nand generate electricity. Pump water meant irrigation, a defense against hunger, which we were\nexperiencing by that time. So I decided I would build one windmill for myself. But I didn’t\nhave materials to use, so I went to a scrap yard where I found my materials. Many people, including\nmy mother, said I was crazy.<br/>I found a tractor fan, shock absorber, PVC pipes. Using a bicycle\nframe and an old bicycle dynamo, I built my machine. It was one light at first. And then four lights,\nwith switches, and even a circuit breaker, modeled after an electric bell. Another machine pumps\nwater for irrigation.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
