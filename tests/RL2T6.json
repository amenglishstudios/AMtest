Jamie Oliver,\na chef and activist, wanted to help—and started a food revolution.<br/>Celebrity chef Jamie\nOliver is on a mission to change people’s eating habits. As part of his mission, Oliver opened\na new community food center in Huntington, West Virginia, in 2009. Oliver chose Huntington largely\nbecause of the city’s high rates of food-related illnesses. <br/>At the time, over 45 percent of\nthe adult population was obese, according to a government report. Oliver’s team spent five\nmonths in Huntington coaching people about fresh food. At the food center, called Jamie’s\nKitchen, his team taught cooking lessons and served healthy meals. Three years after the Kitchen\nopened, obesity levels in Huntington had dropped by 10 percent.<br/>NO FOOD CULTURE<br/>In his books\nand on his TV shows, Oliver highlights why eating healthily is such a challenge today. At the heart\nof the issue is widespread ignorance. Oliver thinks many people, particularly children, are out of\ntouch with what’s on their plates. They are not aware of the ingredients in the food they eat\nor how it was made. At home, at school, and on Main Street, people are no longer learning about good\nfood, cooking, and healthy eating.<br/>In the past, Oliver explains, dinners at home were usually\ncooked with fresh ingredients. However, over the past 30 years, convenience foods have replaced fresh\nhome-cooked meals. These convenience foods are highly processed and full of additives. While these\nadditives increase the shelf life of foods, they can be harmful to our health. Processed\nfoods<sup>1</sup> are also common in schools. Too often, the main criterion for choosing which meals\nto serve is cost. This means children are fed meals that are mass-produced using unhealthy\ningredients.<br/>Oliver also sees problems on “Main Street”—the stores and\nrestaurants where people buy food. Fast-food restaurants offer cheap meals that are often high in\nsugar and fat, but low in nutrition. Additionally, the portion sizes in many restaurants are huge,\nencouraging people to eat more than is healthy. In supermarkets, food labeling can be confusing or\nmisleading. For example, Oliver wonders how supermarkets can “say something is low-fat when\nit’s full of so much sugar.”<br/>CREATING A MOVEMENT<br/>Oliver has some ideas about how we\ncan address these problems. For example, he encourages people to share simple recipes, so that more\npeople get into the habit of home cooking. He also suggests that supermarkets hire “food\nambassadors” to help consumers make better choices about the foods they buy. He urges big food\nbrands to provide better labeling on their products. He has also worked with schools to develop\nhealthier meals, and to help children learn about good nutrition.<br/>Inspired by his experiences in\nHuntington, Oliver created an annual event called Food Revolution Day. Food Revolution Day events\nraise awareness of how food affects our well-being and remind people that cooking with fresh\ningredients is fun. In 2014, groups in over 100 countries participated. Through initiatives like Food\nRevolution Day and Jamie’s Kitchen, Jamie Oliver hopes people will live healthier lives. Oliver\nwants to create “a movement to educate every child about food [and] to inspire\nfamilies to cook again.”</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

The report said that in 2002, “30\npercent of 13- to 15-year-olds were estimated to be overweight—this was double the expected\nnumber.\" Among the adult population, Scotland has very high rates of heart disease, cancer,\nand strokes.  Poor diet, among other problems, is a major cause of these illnesses. <br/>History\nshows how the Scottish diet changed over time.  Before the Industrial Revolution, people ate\nlocally grown/raised food, such as oats, vegetables, venison, and seafood.  But when many people\nmoved from the countryside to urban areas, they had less access to these healthy foods.  Frying\nfoods, compared to less fattening methods, became popular as a safe way to cook. (<u>It</u> killed\nbacteria and viruses.)  Also, the sugar trade during the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup>\ncenturies increased the amount of sweet foods people consumed.<br/>Some people think history and\nstatistics are used to make a situation seem more serious than it really is.  Kevin McIndoe, a\nnewspaper journalist from Glasgow, Scotland, says the Scots’ reputation as unhealthy eaters is\n<u>exaggerated</u>.  It’s a stereotype like any other, such as saying “everyone in\nLondon likes jellied eels.”  McIndoe may be right.  After all, almost everybody\n(especially children) loves sweets, and any country that has been through the Industrial Revolution\nhas had some diet changes.  But for any health-conscious eater, avoiding sweet treats like\ndeep-fried Mars bars may be best.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
