In fact, people may benefit from online gaming in a number of\nways. For example, multiplayer online gaming can improve social skills because players have to work\ntogether toward the same goals. In one study, researchers in the Netherlands surveyed teens who\nplayed <i>World of Warcraft</i>. They found that the more frequently most teens played, the more\nsocially successful and less lonely they felt.<br/>Online gaming may also improve thinking skills. In\na recent study in Berlin, adults played a video game every day for two months.  Afterwards,\nresearchers scanned the players’ brains. They noticed that the players had more neurons in the\nparts of the brain that are responsible for memory and planning. <br/>Game designer Jane McGonigal has\nher own ideas about the benefits of gaming—not just for individual people, but for the whole\nworld. She calls people who play online games for at least one hour a day “virtuoso”\ngamers. Currently, there are about 500 million virtuoso gamers in the world. McGonigal predicts that\nin ten years there will be 1.5 billion. <br/>McGonigal believes that these gamers have four\ncharacteristics—“superpowers”—that make them better problem solvers. These\ncharacteristics are:<br/>• Urgent <u>optimism</u>: Online gamers don’t wait to defeat a\ndragon. Instead, gamers face any problem immediately—and believe that they can\nsucceed.<br/>• Community builders: Players in an online game have the same goal—to win.\nThey expect that everyone will play fairly and follow the same rules. This helps players build trust\nand improve cooperation.<br/>• Blissful productivity: Gamers enjoy working hard to achieve\nonline gaming goals. They feel a real sense of accomplishment when they do achieve these\ngoals—the “epic win” feeling.<br/>• Epic meaning: Gamers like being involved\nin an important mission. The larger-than-life worlds of online gaming make players feel that they are\nplaying a part in a significant story. <br/>Non-gamers may think online gaming is a waste of time and\nmoney. Some have argued online games contribute to problems like childhood obesity. However,\nMcGonigal thinks online gamers could be an important global resource if we can design games that help\nthem create “epic wins” in response to real-world problems.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

She makes “alternate reality games,” which aim to harness the unique\nskills of gamers to solve problems in the real world.<br/><b><i>Superbetter</i>\n(2012)<br/></b>McGonigal was inspired to create her game <i>Superbetter </i>when she was recovering\nfrom a serious concussion injury. The game aims to encourage players to remain optimistic, even when\nfacing the toughest challenges that life can throw at us. According to McGonigal, more than half a\nmillion players have played the game, and many found that it could help them overcome illnesses and\nother problems in their lives. A trial by The University of Pennsylvania supports her claim.\nFollowing a controlled trial of <i>Superbetter</i>, it was found that the game could help eliminate\nsymptoms of depression in just six weeks of play.<br/><b><i>Breakthrough to Cures</i> (2009)\n<br/></b><i>Breakthrough to Cures</i> was designed to change the way we think about medical research.\nPlayers are thrust into a future where disease is threatening the lives of 100 million people in the\nU.S.A. Then, over a period of 24 hours, gamers are asked to work together to brainstorm solutions to\nthe problem. Players can <u>level-up</u> and gain rewards for contributing useful ideas. As a result\nof the wide variety of creative ideas generated by the game, <i>Breakthrough to Cures</i> was named\nas one of the 10 most socially impactful games of 2010 by the organization Games for Change.<br/>The\nsuccess of <i>Breakthrough to Cures</i> has led to the development of other games for solving future\nproblems. For example, <i>Smart Grid 2025</i> has been designed to help tackle the energy problems\nthat the world may face in years to come.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
