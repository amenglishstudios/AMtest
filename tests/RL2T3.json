Speakers at recent TED events\nhave shared simple and inexpensive solutions that can solve everyday problems.<br/>LIQUID\nLENSES<br/>Many people need eyeglasses, but there often aren’t enough eye doctors in the\ndeveloping world. For example, there’s only one optometrist for every 8 million people in some\nparts of Africa. Physicist Joshua Silver has a solution: Adjust your own eyeglasses. <br/>Silver\ninvented eyeglasses that have lenses filled with a liquid. You turn a dial on the sides of the\nglasses to add or subtract the liquid. Adjusting the amount of liquid changes the strength of the\nlenses, making it easier for people to see better. The glasses cost $19 today, but Silver hopes to\nget this down to $1 by 2020.<br/>FUEL BRIQUETTES<br/>In the developing world, smoke from indoor cooking\nkills more than 2 million children each year. In fact, it’s the number one cause of death of\nchildren under five. Amy Smith, founder of D-Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT),\ndiscovered a way to make a safe cooking fuel. The material she uses is also free and plentiful: farm\nwaste. <br/>Smith invented a low-cost device that compresses<sup>1</sup> farm waste into fuel\nbriquettes. These briquettes produce smoke that is less dangerous than the smoke from other fuel,\nsuch as wood. They also burn hotter and last longer. Farmers can make these briquettes from readily\navailable waste, such as hay in India and corncobs in Ghana. This innovation has an economic benefit,\ntoo. Farmers can buy the press for $2 and sell briquettes they don’t use. Smith estimates that\nthis can increase a farmer’s income by $500 a month.<br/>DISASTER SHELTERS<br/>Over 31 million\npeople worldwide lose their homes every year due to natural disasters such as hurricanes and\nearthquakes. After these disasters, many people live in terrible conditions—in tents or in\nlarge arenas with no privacy. Graphic designer Michael McDaniel invented inexpensive, temporary\nhousing for people in these situations.<br/>Called the Reaction Exo, these shelters are small,\none-room houses that comfortably hold up to four people. They’re made from a plastic that is\nstrong, recyclable, and super light. In fact, they’re so light that you can lift them by hand.\nThe shelters are very portable<sup>2</sup>—you can stack them like paper cups to transport them\neasily. They snap together, so you can make one large shelter with several rooms. McDaniel hopes that\nhis invention will provide an affordable solution to help people rebuild their lives after a natural\ndisaster. <br/><b><sup>1</sup>compress</b>:<i> v.</i> presses together<br/><b><sup>2</sup>portable</b>:\n<i>adj.</i> movable, capable of being carried or moved around</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
