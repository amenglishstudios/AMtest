We often worry about what others will think of us because of\nour clothes. But researchers are beginning to think that our clothing has an equally powerful effect\non how we see ourselves.<br/><br/>Scientists Adam Galinsky and Hajo Adams report that there is science\nbehind our style. In their research, Galinsky and Adams had some participants wear white lab coats\nsimilar to the ones scientists or doctors wear. Other participants wore their normal clothes. The\nparticipants took a test that measured their ability to pay attention. The people wearing the white\ncoats performed<b> </b>better than the people in regular clothes.<br/><br/>Galinsky and Adams think\nthat the white coats made the participants feel more confident and careful. The researchers also\nbelieve that other kinds of “symbolic” clothes can influence the behavior<b> </b>of the\npeople wearing them. A police officer’s uniform<b> </b>or a judge’s robe, for example,\nincrease the wearer’s feeling of power or confidence. And in workplaces that have a dress code,\n“symbolic” clothes may also affect how well employees do their jobs.<br/><br/>Fashion\nblogger Jessica Quirk believes that our clothes greatly affect how we feel about ourselves. According\nto Quirk, “There is joy and luck<b> </b>and confidence in what we wear.” On her blog\ncalled “What I Wore,” Quirk posts a photo of what she’s wearing every day. She says\nthat people should pay more attention to what they wear. For example, we should choose a look that\nmakes us feel more creative<b> </b>and happy. One way to do this at work is to “dress up for\nthe exciting job we want,” she says, “not the boring job we have.” Another way is\nto wear special clothes that mean something to us. For example, Quirk wears one pair of shoes to all\nher important meetings. They are her “lucky” shoes.<br/><br/>As Quirk points out—and\nas researchers have discovered—our clothes are “like our second skin.” The clothes\nwe wear can affect our behavior. They can also tell the world something about us, without us having\nto say a word.<br/><br/>NOW PAY ATTENTION!<br/><br/>In Galinsky and Adams’s experiment,\nparticipants saw cards with different-colored words on them. Participants had to say the color of the\nword they saw, not the word itself.<br/><br/>The people wearing the lab coats said the correct color of\nthe word more often. The researchers believe that wearing lab coats made participants pay more\nattention to the test. Their behavior was, in fact, more like that of a doctor or a\nscientist.<br/><br/><b>symbolic: </b><i>adj. </i>representing something<br/><b>influence: </b><i>v.\n</i>to affect people or things<br/><b>dress code: </b><i>n. </i>a set of rules for what you can\nwear<br/><b>look: </b><i>n. </i>a style or fashion</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

What makes their shoes so\nspecial?<br/><br/>THE SHOE DESIGNER<br/><br/>Born to a Spanish mother and a Czech father, Manolo Blahnik\ngrew up in the Canary Islands near north Africa. In his twenties, he moved to New York City and began\nto design shoes for women. Today, his high heels (often called “Manolos”) are known\naround the world. “Women love my shoes,” says Blahnik. “Some never take them\noff.”<br/><br/>Why are his shoes so popular? Yes, they’re beautiful. On the other hand, his\nhigh heels aren’t always particularly comfortable. They’re also costly; prices range from\nhundreds to thousands of dollars. Maybe the best answer is this: each pair of Manolos is a work of\nart—like a painting by Picasso.<br/><br/>But aren’t they just shoes? “Yes, only\nshoes,” says Blahnik. “But, if they bring a bit of happiness to someone, then, perhaps,\nthey are something more than shoes.”<br/><br/>THE SHOE ENGINEER<br/><br/>At $30,000 a pair, moon\nboots aren’t cheap. But to walk in space, you need high-tech shoes—like those designed by\nDave Graziosi. He and his team are making space boots for NASA. “We’re planning for the\nmoon and beyond,” he says.<br/><br/>The latest space boot is the M2 Trekker. These boots are\nsmaller and weigh less than the ones Neil Armstrong wore to the moon. In them, astronauts can walk\ncomfortably on the moon’s rocky surface. M2 Trekkers also protect astronauts’ feet from\nextreme cold and heat. They can be worn in temperatures ranging from –212ºC to\n+177ºC. They are truly more than just a shoe!</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

But before\nI show you what I’ve got inside, I’m going to make a very public confession, and that is,\nI’m outfit-obsessed. I love finding, wearing, and more recently, photographing and blogging a\ndifferent colorful, crazy outfit for every single occasion. But I don’t buy anything new. I get\nall my clothes secondhand from flea markets and thrift stores<sup>1</sup>. Secondhand shopping allows\nme to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet. I get to meet all kinds\nof great people; my dollars usually go to a good cause; I look pretty unique; and it makes shopping\nlike my own personal treasure hunt.<br/><br/>... I’m also going to tell you a few of the life\nlessons that, believe it or not, I have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing\nnew.<br/><br/><b>Part 2<br/></b><br/>So let’s start with Sunday. I call this “Shiny\nTiger.” You do not have to spend a lot of money to look great. You can almost always look\nphenomenal for under $50. This whole outfit, including the jacket, cost me $55, and it was the most\nexpensive thing that I wore the entire week.<br/><br/>Monday: Color is powerful. It is almost\nphysiologically impossible to be in a bad mood when you’re wearing bright red pants. If you are\nhappy, you are going to attract other happy people to you.<br/><br/>Tuesday: Fitting in is way\noverrated. I’ve spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in.\nJust be who you are. If you are surrounding yourself with the right people, they will not only get\nit, they will appreciate it.<br/><br/>Wednesday: Embrace your inner child. Sometimes people tell me\nthat I look like I’m playing dress-up, or that I remind them of their seven-year-old. I like to\nsmile and say, “Thank you.”<br/><br/>Thursday: Confidence is key. If you think you look\ngood in something, you almost certainly do. And if you don’t think you look good in something,\nyou’re also probably right. I grew up with a mom who taught me this day in and day out. But it\nwasn’t until I turned 30 that I really got what this meant. ... <br/><br/>Friday: A universal\ntruth—five words for you: Gold sequins<sup>2</sup> go with everything ...<br/><br/> ... So\nobviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase. So before I go home to Brooklyn,\nI’m going to donate everything back. Because the lesson I’m trying to learn myself this\nweek is that it’s okay to let go. I don’t need to get emotionally attached to these\nthings because around the corner, there is always going to be another crazy, colorful, shiny outfit\njust waiting for me, if I put a little love in my heart and\nlook.<br/><br/><sup>______________________<br/><br/>1</sup> <b>Flea markets and thrift stores</b>: places\nto buy secondhand (used) goods<br/><sup>2  </sup><b>Sequins</b>: <i>n. </i>shiny pieces of\nplastic that can be attached to clothing</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
