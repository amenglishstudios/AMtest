These animals, known as cephalopods, are able to\nchange the appearance of their skin. Squid, octopi, and cuttlefish are all types of cephalopods. Each\nof these animals has special cells under its skin that contain pigment, a colored liquid. A\ncephalopod can move these cells toward or away from its skin. This allows it to change the pattern\nand color of its appearance.<br/><br/>Cephalopods mainly use these cells as camouflage to hide from\npredators. For example, cephalopods can blend in to the color of the sea floor, making them invisible\nto predators. They can also change color to scare predators away. For example, the skin of the\nCaribbean reef squid is usually a plain brown. When a predator passes close by, the squid makes large\n“eye” patterns on its skin. This makes the squid appear much bigger than it really is.\nSquid can also use these cells to communicate other messages. When two male reef squid fight, black\nand white lines appear on their skin. These send a message that the squid is fierce. A reef squid\nsearching for a mate can flash colorful patterns, sending a message that it is\nattractive.<br/><br/>Amazingly, reef squid can send two messages at the same time. They can send one\nmessage on their right side and a different message on their left side. For example, when males are\nsearching for a mate, they flash attractive patterns on one side of their body. This is the side a\nfemale sees. On the other side of their bodies, they can show their fierce zebra stripes. This is the\nside other males see. They can quickly flip the messages if the female swims to the other\nside!<br/><br/>With the ability to display 30 colors and patterns, the incredible Caribbean reef squid\nreally is a master of disguise and a skillful communicator.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

The first is to protect\nthe coastline. Reefs serve as barriers<sup>1</sup> between the coast and powerful\nocean storms. Reefs also protect coastlines from erosion<sup>2</sup>. The Maldives,\nan island nation in the Indian Ocean, has built reefs to protect its coast from storms that\nmay lead to beach erosion.<br/><br/>The second reason people construct reefs is to promote\nsea life for recreation and aquaculture. A reef contains many forms of life.\nPlants, plankton, algae, sponges, eels, fish, crabs, and sea turtles are just some of the\norganisms that live in healthy reefs. The wide variety of fish makes recreational\nfishing<sup>3</sup><i> </i>popular around reefs.  Brightly colored fish also make reefs popular\nwith divers and snorkelers. Artificial reefs off the Atlantic coast of the U.S. states of Florida,\nGeorgia, and South Carolina have helped bring more forms of sea life to the area, and this\nhas encouraged tourism.<br/><br/>Aquaculture—also called fish farming--is the cultivation of\nocean life for food and industry. A reef provides shelter for many different\nkinds of fish, so fish farmers can increase their catch by building reefs. Japan creates artificial\nreefs to encourage the growth of schools<sup>4</sup> of snapper and other types of food fish, for\ninstance. Japan is also a leader in creating artificial reefs for pearl-producing\noysters. <br/><br/>A third reason for building reefs is to create waves that promote the\nsport of surfing. Surfers ride boards on top of waves. Artificial reefs can help make\nbigger waves and make surfing more fun. El Segundo, California, was the first area to try an\nartificial reef to improve surfing. Australian beaches at Perth and the Gold Coast have also built\nartificial reefs for this purpose.<br/><br/>Building underwater barriers is not new. For many years,\npeople who live near the coast have depended on artificial reefs for protection. Two thousand years\nago, the Greek historian Strabo wrote that the Persians built reef barriers across the Tigris\nRiver to prevent pirates from India from crossing it. <br/><br/>Ancient peoples like the\nPersians built artificial reefs out of organic material such as trees and inorganic\nmaterial such as rocks. These days, engineers use a much wider—and stranger—variety of\nmaterials for reef-building.<br/><br/>Sunken ships have provided reef structures for hundreds of years.\nToday, the engineers who create these artificial reefs do not just sink them. They first remove all\nplastic and toxic materials from the ships. They then carefully place explosives to sink\nstructures in just the right location. The old aircraft carrier<sup>5</sup>\nUSS <i>Oriskany</i> is now a reef in the Gulf of Mexico. New York City subway cars have\nbeen sunk for reefs along the East Coast of the U.S. from New Jersey to Georgia. <br/><br/>Reef balls\nare another type of artificial reef. Reef balls are circular structures with holes for fish and other\ncreatures to swim through and live in. They are constructed mainly of concrete. Reef balls can be\nused to build a new artificial reef or to help repair a damaged reef. They have been used in Prince\nWilliam Sound, Alaska, and many other locations. <br/><br/><span style=\"font-size:9pt\"><sup>1</sup>\n<b>barrier:</b> <i>n. </i>something that limits movement; something that makes it difficult to move\nforward<br/><sup>2</sup> <b>erosion:</b> <i>n. </i>the process by which the surface of the Earth is\nworn away by the movement of waves, <br/>   wind, moving water, etc. <br/><sup>3</sup>\n<b>recreational fishing:</b> fishing for fun or for sport, not as a professional\nactivity<br/><sup>4</sup> <b>schools of fish:</b> large groups of fish<br/><sup>5</sup> <b>aircraft\ncarrier:</b> <i>n.</i> a ship that carries military airplanes<br/><br/></span><span style=\"font-size:9pt\"><br/></span></div><div class=\"default\"><table border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" width=\"95%\"><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td width=\"4%\"><div class=\"choice\">a.</div></td><td width=\"96%\"><span class=\"default\">the Maldives</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">b.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">Florida, Georgia,\nand South Carolina</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">c.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">Japan</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">d.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">El Segundo,\nCalifornia</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">e.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">Perth and the Gold Coast in Australia</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">f.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">the Tigris River</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">g.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">India</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">h.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">New York City</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">i.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">the Gulf of\nMexico</span></td></tr><tr valign=\"baseline\"><td><div class=\"choice\">j.</div></td><td><span class=\"default\">Prince William Sound, Alaska</span></td></tr></table></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

Some, like owls, have very large eyes that they use to\ncollect lots of light. They also use their other senses to gather information about their\nsurroundings. Humans, on the other hand, have put a lot of effort into lighting <u>their</u> way by\ncreating portable artificial light sources, from torches<sup>3</sup> to automobile\nheadlights. Bioluminescent life forms have an entirely different approach—they make light\n<u>themselves</u> and carry it around in their bodies.<br/><br/>You can find bioluminescent life forms\nall over the world. Some are land animals, such as insects, centipedes, and worms. One of the most\nwidely-known luminescent creatures is the firefly<sup>4</sup>. People who live near fireflies\noften think of <u>them</u> as brightly flashing adult insects, but firefly larvae<sup>5</sup> glow as\nwell. <br/><br/>Most of the world's bioluminescence exists in the ocean, not on land, and\nmost live in one particular depth—called the twilight zone<sup>6</sup>, or the\ndisphotic, zone. It's deeper than the sunlit, or euphotic, zone, but shallower than the\nmidnight, or aphotic zone. The twilight zone extends from about 200 meters to about 1000\nmeters deep.<br/><br/>Only a small amount of light from the sun reaches the twilight zone.\nThe light that does penetrate this far is bluish-green in color. This is partly because blue-green\nlight has a short wavelength, so <u>it</u> has more energy with which to penetrate the water. Lots of\nbioluminescent animals live <u>here</u>, including jellyfish, squid, shrimp, marine worms,\nand fish. Most make light that matches the blue-green sunlight that exists in this part of the ocean.\nThe glow produced by these animals can travel a long way, and <u>it</u> can blend in with the light\nfrom above. In some parts of the ocean, these animals, not the sun, are the primary source of\nlight.<br/><br/><span style=\"font-size:9pt\"><sup>1</sup> <b>bioluminescence: </b><i>n.</i> light that\nis made by living creatures<br/><sup>2</sup> <b>navigate:</b> <i>v.</i> to move from place to\nplace<br/><sup>3</sup> <b>torches:</b> <i>n. </i>lights carried in the hand<br/><sup>4</sup>\n<b>firefly:</b> <i>n.</i> a flying insect that emits a flashing light<br/><sup>5</sup> <b>larvae:\n</b><i>n.</i> the immature forms of some insects<br/><sup>6</sup> <b>twilight: </b><i>n.</i> a term\nusually used to mean the time between day and night.

That’s the unknown world, and today we’ve only explored about three percent of\nwhat’s out there in the ocean. Already we’ve found the world’s highest mountains,\nthe world’s deepest valleys, underwater lakes, underwater waterfalls—a lot of that we\nshared with you from the stage. And in a place where we thought no life at all, we find more life, we\nthink, and diversity and density than the tropical rain forest, which tells us that we don’t\nknow much about this planet at all. There’s still 97 percent, and either that 97 percent is\nempty or just full of surprises.<br/><br/>But I want to jump up to shallow water now and look at some\ncreatures that are positively amazing. Cephalopods—headfoots. As a kid, I knew them as\ncalamari, mostly. This is an octopus—this is the work of Dr. Roger Hanlon at the Marine\nBiological Lab—and it’s just fascinating how cephalopods can, with their incredible eyes,\nsense their surroundings, look at light, look at patterns. Here’s an octopus moving across the\nreef, finds a spot to settle down, curls up, and then disappears into the background. Tough thing to\ndo. <br/><br/>. . . Cuttlefish. I love cuttlefish. This is a giant Australian cuttlefish. And there he\nis, his droopy little eyes up here. But they can do pretty amazing things, too. Here we’re\ngoing to see one backing into a crevice, and watch his tentacles—he just pulls them in, makes\nthem look just like algae. Disappears right into the background. Positively amazing. Here’s two\nmales fighting. Once again, they’re smart enough, these cephalopods; they know not to hurt each\nother. But look at the patterns that they can do with their skin. That’s an amazing\nthing.<br/><br/>Here’s an octopus. Sometimes they don’t want to be seen when they move\nbecause predators can see them. Here, this guy actually can make himself look like a rock, and,\nlooking at his environment, can actually slide across the bottom, using the waves and the shadows so\nhe can’t be seen . . . The shallow water’s full of predators—here’s a\nbaracuda—and if you’re an octopus or a cephalopod, you need to really understand how to\nuse your surroundings to hide.</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
