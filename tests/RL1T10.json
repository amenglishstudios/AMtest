Nexi is one of a new generation of robots. It moves on wheels\nand can pick up objects. But robots like Nexi are more than just entertaining\ntoys.<br/><br/><b>INTERACTING WITH ROBOTS<br/><br/></b>Roboticists at the Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology (MIT) call Nexi a “social robot.” A social robot is a robot that can\ncommunicate like a human. It can express human emotions. Nexi can look sad, mad, and even bored. Some\nsocial robots can also “read” our facial expressions. For example, Nexi can see that we\nare sad and can say something to make us happy. Roboticists, like MIT’s Cynthia Breazeal,\nbelieve that it won’t be long before we have social robots in our homes, helping us live better\nlives. <br/><br/>Autom is another social robot developed at MIT. Autom is a robot health coach. It has\na screen where you enter information about what food you ate that day or how much you exercised.\nAutom has a face with eyes that move. It speaks with a synthesized voice. Autom gives you advice\nabout your diet and exercise, and motivates you to do better. <br/><br/>In a test, Autom helped people\nlose weight better than other ways of recording diet information. Breazeal thinks this is because\nAutom used facial expressions and words of encouragement. In other words, Autom interacted like a\nreal person. In fact, many people who used Autom gave the robot a new name and talked to it. When\nrobots use human expressions and body language, Breazeal says, people respond to them “a lot\nlike they respond to people.” <br/><br/>In the future, humans may interact with social robots\njust like they do with other people. The robot of the future will be not just a machine; it may also\nbe your coach, helper, or friend.<br/><br/></div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",

Air\nflows beneath silicone skin, raising her arms and lifting the corners of her mouth into a smile.

But in spite of the $250,000 spent on making her, she does not move smoothly and\nher face is inelastic<sup>1</sup>.<br/><br/><b>Paragraph 3<br/></b><br/>This model has been transported\nto Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh to acquire something like a personality. At least this is\nwhat five optimistic graduate students in the university’s Entertainment Technology Center are\nhoping. They have been given 15 weeks to make this robot seem more like a human female. They have\nbegun by renaming her Yume—dream, in Japanese. “The Kokoro Company developed her to be\nphysically realistic, but that’s not enough by itself,” says Christine Barnes, student\nco-producer of the Yume Project. “What we’re going to do is shift the focus from realism\nto believability.”<br/><br/><b>Paragraph 4<br/></b><br/>The Actroid androids are part of a new\ngeneration of robots designed to function not as programmed machines, but independently—capable\nof taking on roles in our homes, schools, and offices previously done only by humans. The first\nexamples of this type of robot were the Roomba robots that can vacuum our carpets, and the electronic\npets that sit up and roll over on command. More advanced robots may soon be available that cook for\nus, fold the laundry, even take care of our children or elderly parents, while we watch and assist\nfrom a computer miles away.  “In five or ten years, robots will routinely be functioning\nin human environments,” says Reid Simmons, a professor of robotics at Carnegie\nMellon.<br/><br/><b>Paragraph 5<br/></b><br/>This leads to many questions. How much everyday human\nfunction do we want to give to machines? Do we want robots like Yume cooking in our kitchens? How\nwill the robot revolution change the way we relate to each other?

And as a little girl, I loved the\nidea of a robot that interacted with us much more like a helpful, trusted sidekick—something\nthat would delight us, enrich our lives, and help us save a galaxy or two. I knew robots like that\ndidn’t really exist, but I knew I wanted to build them. . . .<br/><br/>So over the past several\nyears I’ve been continuing to explore this interpersonal dimension of robots, now at the Media\nLab with my own team of incredibly talented students. And one of my favorite robots is Leonardo. We\ndeveloped Leonardo in collaboration with Stan Winston Studio. .. <br/><br/>... what I’ve learned\nthrough building these systems is that robots are actually a really intriguing social technology,\nwhere it’s actually their ability to push our social buttons and to interact with us like a\npartner that is a core part of their functionality. And with that shift in thinking, we can now start\nto imagine new questions, new possibilities for robots that we might not have thought about\notherwise. But what do I mean when I say “push our social buttons”? Well, one of the\nthings that we’ve learned is that, if we design these robots to communicate with us using the\nsame body language, the same sort of non-verbal cues that people use—like Nexi, our humanoid\nrobot, is doing here—what we find is that people respond to robots a lot like they respond to\npeople. People use these cues to determine things like how persuasive someone is, how likable, how\nengaging, how trustworthy. It turns out it’s the same for robots. . .</div>\n<div class=\"spacer\"> </div>\n",
