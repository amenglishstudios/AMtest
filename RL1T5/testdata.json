      "passage": "Every month, people worldwide upload about 6 billion photos to the Internet. Photography is now so common, it is easy to forget that photographs — and the memories they hold — can be very precious.\n\nMEMORY ARCHIVE\n\nIn a cold, windowless basement in Washington D.C., there is a man who knows the real value of a photograph. Since 1983, Bill Bonner has looked after National Geographic’s photo archive. The archive holds around 8 million prints — many over 100 years old.\n\nIn his long career, Bonner has looked at hundreds of thousands of photos. He believes each image holds a memory. Some of the pictures record moments in history. Many others, he says, show “people like us, just doing our thing, living our life.” Many of these memories have been forgotten by the outside world. But they still have the power to tell us a lot about the past.\n\nIMAGES FROM THE PAST\n\nWhen the archive’s earliest photos were taken, photography was difficult and expensive. Photographers needed special equipment and chemicals to develop their pictures. Cameras were large and heavy — some weighed 20 pounds (9 kilos) or more. Early explorers used these massive cameras to photograph people and places that most people had never seen.\n\nPhotography expeditions took several months, or even years. “They dedicated their lives to this,” Bonner says. Bonner feels responsible for keeping these memories alive, for people now and in the future. Many of the images are fragile, and he has to be very careful to preserve them. For Bonner, these figures from the distant past are almost like his ancestors. “For me,” he says, “it’s like opening your grandparents’ family album for the first time.”",
